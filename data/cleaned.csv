105,1,"Hey people,    I must say, it's a bit exhausting at the moment.   I repeatedly read that hyping is cheap and downright shady, that it will hurt the project and that IOTA is not ready yet, so stop hyping.   I mean the official roadmap shows June 2021 as the planned date for IOTA 2.0 aka coordicide.   I guess later but so be it.   Chrysalis is on the doorstep and a whole lot of significant updates are coming soon that really show what IOTA is all about.   The list of changes is long, and probably well known, but just to touch on that, there is little reason to believe that after chrysalis that we won't trigger another defi mania, because once smart contracts are integrated, there will be no more fees. That's probably scheduled for a later date but it's definitely coming.   Reusable addresses, switching from WOTS to EDDSA, using rust and a new wallet with a messenger function are still the smallest (compared to the rest), though already huge improvements.  Finally IOTA can be called production ready, Charly said yesterday.  Finally companies can count on network stability and their products are already being built.   Well I for one am now moderately hyped, which is also quite nice in the midst of these dreary times -and for me it's a very simple calculation:   Higher token price + more awareness = stronger community and more funds for projects around IOTA.   Now, at the beginning of the (alt)bullmarket is the right time to make this calculation work, and not after the coordicide.   Coordicide might come after the bullmarket, who knows, but I feel like the conviction ""please no hype, it will hurt iota"" as straight up dangerous for the whole thing -especially now that something quantifiable is coming - in 8 weeks!   It is no longer 2018, IOTA is no longer in the focus of the raging media and there is no more controversy around the topic curl-p. I think we can leave that behind us.   Now that we can see meaningful updates, we should express confidence instead of this constant doubt.  The network effect is created by people, and here is one of the hotspots of the IOTA supporters.  Bitcoin without its huge network effect and people showing any form of confidence would be at $7, I guess.  So if we want to have a direct impact we should show our excitement instead of pointing fingers at those who do.  Most of the IF people agreed and said there is nothing wrong with showing excitement and a higher price would directly improve the ecosystem. But as we all know, the IF mustn't hype and I doubt they will.      But from a marketing perspective, a huge difference can be made right now, which everyone would like to see.    And preferably not after 2022, when IOTA might be at CMC rank 100, competing with dying stars that will leave the space forever.","Hype is necessary and the sentiment of ""don't hype, it's shady"" is downright dangerous for the project."

Created a Trinity Wallet 2. Creating the Trinity wallet required the extension of the Seed to 81 characters with 9's. 3. Refreshed Snapshot transition 1 million times. Give or take. 4.

Why is that true? There should be fewer adversarial nodes than honest nodes and therefore any influence they exert should not be enough to make the number of 1-responses a node receives independent from the responses another node receives. If an honest node already knows that the number of 1-responses a different node got is pretty high than that should influence its probability to get a higher number of 1-responses as well which makes them dependent on each other.",FPC-BI: Why are the number of 1 responses conditionally independent given the adversary's strategy?

Those applications allow to securely share trusted and immutable data among multiple stakeholders. For this purpose, Zebra Savanna now offers publicly the IOTA Track&amp;Trace Ledger REST API, allowing developers to build and test novel track and trace solutions.**  **IOTA** **is an open source DLT that enables sharing of any type of data (particularly IoT data) guaranteeing traceability of their source, alongside with integrity and immutability of the shared information, and dedicated access management, e.g., who can read what.**  **IOTA also incorporates 2nd Layer ledger protocols, such as** **IOTA Streams. This protocol automatically organizes the data on the Ledger making it extremely simple to establish Digital Twins, for example to connect all data regarding shipment movement from end-to-end in a supply chain.**  **Automatic Identification and Data Capture Technologies (AIDC), such as RFID or barcodes, combined with DLT technologies, such as IOTA, can be enablers of a new generation of** ***decentralized applications*****. The final aim is to utilize directly or indirectly captured information through AIDC to build a digital representation (*****Digital Twin*****) of physical items and their context (location, ownership, etc.).**  **Such Digital Twin representation can be published on a DLT, a secure, decentralised and trusted database that preserves integrity and acts as the single source of truth.

If I get it right you can send funds as often as you want to one address, but if you withdraw some funds from that address it leaks a piece of my private key and you have to generate a new public key. The question I'm asking myself is: Why should the founders of IOTA choose such cryptography that leaks a piece of your private key every time you withdraw some funds from it? Does that benefit you in any way?   &amp;#x200B;  Also I shouldn't deposit IOTAs to a Spent Address because they are at risk of being stolen. But if I generate a new address isn't there the exact same problem, because that piece was leaked before?  &amp;#x200B;  Thank you for helping me out!",Public Address generation

It seems I would need to create a new seed on the Ledger. I cannot use my existing seed. I would then transfer funds to the new seed. This doesn't seem safe, ideally I should create the seed as a layer of security.  2. The 24 seed words are generated by the Ledger. Can I not choose my own words. I am skeptical of words offered, if Ledger is compromised then I am definitely compromised. If I choose my words, it is a layer of security. 3. Apparently if I lost my wallet, I can get the funds back using the 24 seed words. I assume I just need to buy a new Ledger and that is the only way using a Ledger. Also I can't get my head around how the new Ledger would figure out my seed with the seed words. It feels like my seed would be saved in Ledger servers somewhere? 4. What is the security difference of saving my seed on a paper wallet vs using Ledger and saving seed words on paper. Either way the weakest link is paper, if someone gets hold of either paper they have my funds.   Lastly I understand I should only buy directly from Ledger, not third party suppliers. I heard the ledger code is not open source, so that is concern. From my view the security risk is concentrated at Ledger, if their offices are compromised, every user is.",Ledger Nano wallet for IOTA

616,1,"Ok, so even without 33% attacks or the coordinator there are some issues with DAG's. Blockchain's bundle every transaction into a block since it is easier to validate 1 block with 100 transactions are valid rather than 100 separate transactions. In addition with IOTA in order to send transaction you are required to validate two other transactions. This requires you to have a full node so that you know the true state of consensus. Small IoT devices cannot host Gb/Tb of data in order to validate so as a result this system doesn't work.   &amp;#x200B;  I hear about snapshots but it seems like you are just trusting a centralized permanode. How exactly does this work and how does it not compromise the decentralization or security of the data.   &amp;#x200B;  How also does shimmer expect to work. Communicating with peers and then changing your node based on them is a recipe for disaster. If one small group is malicious they can control the entire system with gossiping. If it requires every device to communicate with each other it would be pbft with billions of devices which is not feasible.   &amp;#x200B;  One question is about convergence. If nodes are moving at different speeds and their is not limit then infinite scalability will just be infinite separated DAG's since they will never converge. If someone has a datacenter and another person has a rasberry pi. The RPI will never catch up and so could validate a transaction that is a double spend since it does not know the state of the network.     The last thing is why have ""feeless"" transactions. The fee is just paid in electricity instead of cryptocurrency. This does not seem to fit IoT since small devices have minimal electricity but can have a large amount of money accredited to them. Why would the fee be something IoT devices desperately need. Companies would be willing to pay the fee however consuming valuable resources from the IoT devices could cause issues. LPWANs are called LP since they are Low Powered. They operate on batteries and one of the biggest issues is conserving that.   &amp;#x200B;  The project seems interesting however it does not seem possible. If anyone has any answers I would love to hear them. I mean no offense and I am just curious about how the tech operates and whether it is actually feasible.",Does anyone here understand IOTA's technology?

In regard to IOTA, i (as ever so often over the years) I see a lot of people talking about *price*. While, since its inception, IOTA has never been closer to achieving its goal, sentiment with regard to price seems to sit at a diametrical opposite. That's rather odd, considering that there was never a time in which *investing* in IOTA was less dangerous.  The following is a 2+-year old post i saved. In fact, it's the only Reddit post I ever saved. It's a rare and timeless perspective, in my opinion, that although addressing a different issue, befits the current uneasiness quite well and might give some people a different perspective.

Mostly because if it doesn't come through as a cohesive and understandable narrative, families and patients simply cannot turn it into actionable intelligence.  I find, in this community, a similar problem. So much has been written on the idea of 'FUD', and 'HODL' is an arbitrary watchword everywhere, and the reasons why everyone would 'HODL' seem to be largely the same. Either they believe in the intrinsic value of the tech or, to many of the more recent adopters, belief in the 'fact' that their tech is destined to increase in value.  I bought high. I became aware of IOTA at its apogee. I invested like someone who believes he has found a future he wants to be part of and I don't feel bad about this decision. I also do not feel like an idiot.  I have many reasons for investing in IOTA, and few of them have anything to do with wealth at all. I would posit that if you are in IOTA for the 'Lambo', you can't see the self-driving cars, nor do you want the new world IOTA is designed for.  IOTA is not as predatory and parasitic: The largest human financial instruments are derivatives and debt. We could discuss the ethics for hours, but if I could avoid a relationship between a 'mining pool' and my ability to accomplish transactions, why wouldn't I? Less middlemen = more efficiency invariably. Removing gatekeepers should only anger people who desire to be paid toll for being in the right place first.  IOTA could more easily stabilize into usability: Because 'miner' and 'gatekeeper' are roles left out of the system by design, there are fewer internal market forces generating instability.  IOTA has been the subject of withering criticism: I know this is going to sound insane, but bear with me for a moment. IOTA's branding justly accuses other currencies of unnecessary avarice and incompetence. Being anti-consumer or anti-end-user where you don't have to be is not a patchable flaw, it's a brand-ending identity. If IOTA's end-product was not feasible, there would be no reason to attack. The angle of attack is intentionally not ideological. They don't want to have a war of ideas. As I read history, if you have the right idea, you can even fail towards success if necessary. If you have the wrong idea, it eventually becomes apparent.  My conditions for myself, entering this market and not hedging my bets were that I not enter into willful self-deception. My loyalty towards IOTA is considerable, but it is not blind. I understand that a superior product or idea may arrive in direct competition.  The thing I appreciate IOTA's leadership team for, above everything else, is the fact that they have done their best to turn this 'roller coaster' into actionable intelligence. That, in my workplace, would be 'good bedside manner'. I have no background in IT other than being a normal male 'nerd'. I feel that they explain both the problems and potential outcomes in a comprehensible manner. I feel that they have a good balance in communication: In this space, you need to connect enough novelty and excitement to be compelling. This team created a product which requires broad adoption to gain functionality. I feel that this team does an excellent job retaining authenticity and trajectory in a roller-coaster environment. With the primary entry-point to the tech being the trading platforms, (Bitfinex/Binance) I feel that this team has been unusually adept at avoiding becoming nothing more than a market instrument; a means to an end, rather than an end, itself.  I hope that this relative absence of identity crisis and resilient goal-orientation yields this team and community the outcome they've worked for and deserve. Those who only eagerly anticipate counting their crypto's value in dollars lack imagination for what a future economy could be like. Get-rich-quick is a shitty reason to be in crypto. Get-awesome-sooner is the ordinal attitude towards fledgling technology.",Odd thoughts on IOTA narrative - reloaded

The challenges lying are implementing and testing our solution. We are implementing our solution into the Pollen Testnet and typing it up into our research specifications****(the specifications, while not complete, will hopefully be made publicly available soon).**  **After these tasks are done, our solution will go through a rigorous testing phase.****During this time, we will collect performance data, look for attack vectors, and tune the parameters.**  &amp;#x200B;  **domsch**  **the only way for IOTA and crypto-currencies in general to be adopted is via clear and strong regulatory guidelines and frameworks.**  **We often have the situation where a company reaches out to us and wants to use the IOTA token, but they are simply not able to due to uncertainties in regards to taxes, accounting, legal and regulatory questions.**  **The EU is taking a great stance with their new proposal (called MICA) to provide exactly this type of regulatory clarity and guidance we need. So we are very happy about that and see this as a great development for the adoption of IOTA.**  **We are very active in INATBA (in fact Julie is still on the board), are in the Executive Committee of the Digital Chamber of Commerce (https://digitalchamber.org) and are actively working with other regulatory bodies around the world.** **I think that** **especially in 2021, we will be much more pro-active with our outreach and efforts to push for more regulatory guidance (for the IOTA Token, for Tokenization, Smart Contracts, etc.****)****. We are already talking with companies to start case studies around what it means to use the IOTA token - so that will be exciting.**  &amp;#x200B;  **domsch**  **actual product development, will really help us to convince regulators and lawmakers of what IOTA is intended for and where its potential lies.**  &amp;#x200B;  **DavidSonstebo**  **We are actively participating in regulatory matters via entities such as INATBA, as well as with local regulators in individual countries to help shape regulations to favor the adoption of crypto.**  **once the use cases can display real-world value, then deployments will happen regardless.**  &amp;#x200B;  **serguei\_popov**  **""The multiverse"" is quite an ingenious and promising idea that has many components. Actually, quite some of those are being incorporated to the Coordicide already now. The most ""controversial"" part, though, is the pure on-Tangle voting -- Hans thinks it should work fine while I think that it can be attacked**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **Several of our modules have been devloped jointly with researchers in academia. For example, our rate control module is being developed jointly with professor Robert Shorten** **and his team at Imperial College. Moreover,****our team has published several papers in peer reviewed journals and conference proceedings,**  **We are also making sure the entire protocol is audited. First, we have a grant given to Professor Mauro Conti specifcally to vet our solution.**  **you may hear an announcement regarding a similar grant to a second university.Second, eventually will offer bug bounties on our testnet. Lastly, we will hire some firm to audit our software and our protocol.**  &amp;#x200B;  **domsch**  **I would say that** **the entire enterprise and also the broader crypto-community is certainly actively following our developments around Coordicide****.**  **Once that is removed, and with the introduction of Tokenization and Smart Contracts as Layer 2 solutions, there is no reason not to switch to IOTA.**  **there are probably even more who will reach out once we've achieved our objective of being production ready.**  &amp;#x200B;  **serguei\_popov**  **Our objective is to have Honey ready within the first half of 2021.**  **we are very confident that Coordicide will happen in time.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **For Chrysalis, we will implement a deposit system. In order for an address to receive dust (which will be explicitly defined as any output with value less than a certain threshold), that address must already have a minimum balance (either 1 MIota or 1 KIota).** **The total ordering in conflict white flag makes this solution incredibly easy to implement.**  **this solution in the Coordicide needs alterations, because of the lack of total ordering.**  &amp;#x200B;  **HusQy\_IOTA**  **Sharding is part of IOTA 3.0 and currently still in research.**  **there are of course some hard questions that need to be answered but we are pretty confident that these questions can and will be answered.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **Having these layers helps keep the protocol modular and organized.****Indeed,****it is important to be able to track dependencies between the modules, particularly for standardization purposes.****As your question suggests,** **a key component of standardization is the ability to update the standard****(no living protocol is completely static).****Standardization will be accompanied by a versioning system, which tracks backwards compatibility.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **Well, let me try to clear these things up.**  **-The congestion control mechanisms are indifferent to the types of messages in the tangle. Thus non-value transactions (data messages) will be processed in the same way as value transactions (value messages). Thus, in times of congestion, a node will require mana in order to issue either of them.**  **-You will not need mana to simply ‚Äúset up a node‚Äù and monitor the tangle.**  **However, in order to send transactions (or issue any messages) you will need mana in times of congestion.**  &amp;#x200B;  **IF\_Dave**  **The next big one is next month:****Odyssey Momentum; This is a huge multi-day DLT focussed hackathon with a lot of teams and big companies/governments involved working on solutions for the future. The IOTA Foundation is a Ecosystem member of Odyssey and we will be virtually present during the hackathon to help and guide teams working with IOTA.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **Coordicide will not fail.

Of course, bear markets impact our theoretical runway, but The IOTA Foundation is hard at work at diversifying revenue streams so that we become less and less dependent on the token holdings.**  &amp;#x200B;  **IF\_Dave**  **We are constantly working on getting more exchanges to list IOTA, we however do not pay for listings**  **Some exchanges require a standard signature scheme**  **with the introduction of ed25519 in Chrysalis phase 2 that will be introduced and no longer be a restriction.**  &amp;#x200B;  **HusQy\_IOTA**  **Being feeless is one of the most important aspects here since a new technology usually only gets adopted if it is either better or easier to use than existing solutions.**  **if it enables new use cases that would be completely impossible with the existing infrastructure. That is the single biggest reason why I think that IOTA will prevail.**  **An example for such a ""new"" use case is the Kupcrush use case presented by Terry**  &amp;#x200B;  **domsch**  **there are so many amazing use cases enabled with IOTA**  **I would say that****the most specific use cases which gets me really excited is conditional access control based on IOTA payments - in particular for the sharing economy.**  **IOTA Access + IOTA tokens really enable so many exciting new possibilities.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **In fact, with coordicide research coming to an end, we have already started to look into sharding****.****Indeed, sharding will provide the scalability needed to handle the demands of an IoT enabled world.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **We have designed Iota 2.0 to not have large concentrations of power. Unlike PoS systems, Iota will not be a block chain and thus will not be limited by a leader election process.**  **in a DAG, people can information in parallel, and so nodes with small amounts of mana can create messages at the same time with large mana holders.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **In any DLT, ""voting"" needs a sybil protection system, and thus ""voting power"" is linked to some scarce resource.****Typically the allocation of any resource follows some sort of Zipf distribution, meaning that some people will have a lot, and others not.****The best we can do is to make sure that the little guys get their fair share of voting power.**  &amp;#x200B;  **HusQy\_IOTA**  **With Chrysalis and coordicide we are finally moving to being production ready which will most probably also lead to a bigger market share as partners will start to use the technology which will increase the demand for tokens.**  &amp;#x200B;  **HusQy\_IOTA**  **Privacy features are currently not being researched and it might be hard to support that on layer1 but privacy features could definitely be implemented as a 2nd layer solution**  &amp;#x200B;  **domsch**  **We focus on making the base layer of IOTA (namely transactional settlement) as secure and fast as possible. Many of the greater extensions to this core functionality are built on layer 2 (we already have Streams, Access, Identity and now also Smart Contracts)**  &amp;#x200B;  **HusQy\_IOTA**  **There are discussions about increasing the supply** **to be able to still have micro transactions if the token would i.e. cost a few hundred dollars per MIOTA** **but we have not made a final decision, yet.**  &amp;#x200B;  **IF\_Dave**  **We think we have a edge over other technology especially when it comes to fee-less transactions allowing a lot of use-cases that would otherwise be impractical or impossible.Adoption is not a given but a useful technology will be utilized with the right functionality,**  &amp;#x200B;  **DavidSonstebo**  **why we have such a widespread strategy of driving IOTA, not only its development but in industry, academia, regulatory circles, raising awareness, funding ecosystem efforts etc.****I am confident in the position we are in right now.**  **There is a clear demand for financial disruption, data security, and automation.**  **someone has to assemble a killer application that meets the demand; IF is pushing for this with partners**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **Our goal is to have at least 1000 TPS.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **Personally, I think our congestion control algorithm is our greatest innovation.**  **our algorithm can be used in any adversarial setting requiring fairness and consistency.** **Keep an eye out for a blog post that I am writing about it.**  &amp;#x200B;  **HusQy\_IOTA**  **about proof of inclusion?**  **I have started implementing a proof of concept locally and the required data structures and payload types are already done but we won't be able to integrate this into goshimmer until we are done with the current refactoring of the code.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Jakub\_Cech**  **Many of the changes that are part of the Chrysalis would have made it and will make it into Coordicide.****Like the atomic transactions with binary layout. The approach we took was actually opposite - as in, what are the improvements we can already make in the current network without having to wait for Coordicide, and at the same time without disrupting or delaying Coordicide?**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **All the key research questions in coordicide have been answered.**  **in reality, the biggest research challenges are behind us.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Jakub\_Cech**  **When Chrysalis part 2 will be live?**  **We are still aiming for 2020****as still reflected at roadmap.iota.org.** **We want to have a testnet where everyone can test things like the new APIs on, and some initial implementations of specific client libraries****to work with.****This will also allow us to test the node (both Hornet and Bee)** **implementations more in the wild.**  **The new wallet will also be tested on that testnet.**  **The whole testing phase will be a big endeavor, and, at the same time, we will also start auditing many of the implementations,**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **We are in contact currently with OMG, and they are advising us on how to draft our specifications in order to ease the standardization process. Coordicide, or Iota 2.0, actually provides us a chance to start off with a clean state, since we are building it from the ground up with standardization in mind.**  &amp;#x200B;  **IF\_Dave**  **The focus at this point is delivering Chrysalis and Coordicide. DeFi could possibly be done with Smart contracts at a given moment but it's not a focus point at this stage.**  &amp;#x200B;  **domsch**  **about price?**  **We are quite frankly not worried about that. Knowing everything that we have in the pipeline, our ecosystem and how everything around IOTA will mature over the next few months, I am sure that the entire crypto ecosystem will wake up to IOTA and its potential.** **Many participants in the market still have outdated information from 2017 about us, so there is certainly some education to do.****But with Chrysalis and the Coordicide progress, all of that will change.**  &amp;#x200B;  **domsch**  **At the core of it, the IOTA Foundation is a leader in trust protocols and digital infrastructure.We will always remain a R&amp;D organization at our core, as there is a lot more development we can lead when it comes to make our society and economy more fair, trustless and autonomous.**  **I certainly see us evolving into a broader think-tank and expert group to advise governments and large corporations on their strategies - in particular around data, identity and IoT.**  &amp;#x200B;  **HusQy\_IOTA**  **barely any cryptocurrency gets used in the real world.**  **IOTA will soon start to actually be used in real world products and it is likely that this will also have an impact on the price (but I can't really give any details just yet).**  &amp;#x200B;  **domsch**  **ISCP (IOTA Smart Contract Protocol) is based on cryptographic consensus via BLS threshold signatures. That means a certain pre-defined amount of key holders have to come together to alter the state of the contract****or to send funds around.** **If majority of the nodes are offline, the threshold will not be reached and the contract cannot be executed anymore.****There are various ways in how** **we are looking** **at this right now on** **how to make SC recovery** **and easy transitions possible.**  **The beauty of ISCP is that we have a validator set which you can define (can be 3 or it can be 100+), and via an open selection process we can really ensure that the network will be fully decentralized and permissionless.Every smart contract committee (which will be its own network of course) is leveraging the IOTA ledger for security and to make it fully auditable and tamper-proof.****Which means that if a committee acts wrong, we have cryptographic proof of it and can take certain actions.**  **This makes our approach to smart contracts very elegant, secure and scalable.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **No, we will not standardize Iota 1.5. Yes, we do hope that standardization will help adoption by making it easier for corporates to learn our tech.**  &amp;#x200B;  **serguei\_popov**  **In general, I also have to add that** **I'm really impressed by the force of our research department, and I think we have the necessary abilities to handle all future challenges that we might be facing.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **In coordicide, i.e. Iota 2.0, yes all nodes have to process all transactions and must receive all data. Our next major project is sharding, i.e. Iota 3.0 which will remove this requirement, and increase scalability.**  **FPC begins to be vulnerable to attack if the attacker has 30%-40% of the active consensus mana.**  &amp;#x200B;  **HusQy\_IOTA**  **There is no doubt about coordicide working as envisioned.**  &amp;#x200B;  **HusQy\_IOTA**  **When will companies fully implement iota tech?**  **Soon(TM) :P**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **Well first, we are going to make sure that we dont need a plan B :) Second, our plans for the actual deployment are still under discussion. Lastly, we will make sure there is some sort of fail safe, e.g. turning the coordinator back on, or something like that.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **All the key research questions in coordicide have been answered, and each module is designed.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **What will be standardized is the behavior of the modules, particularly their interactions with other nodes and wallets. Implementation details will not be standardized. The standardization will allow anyone to build a node that can run on the IOTA 2.0 network.**  &amp;#x200B;  **DavidSonstebo**  **Tangle EE has its own Slack (private) and calls, so the lack of activity can probably be explained in that fashion. Coordicide will have an impact on all of IOTA :) There's certainly a lot of entities awaiting it, but most will start building already with Chrysalis v2, since it solves most pain points.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **If there are no conflicts, a message will be confirmed if it receives some approvals. We estimate that this should happen within 10-20 seconds.**  **To resolve a conflict, FPC will typically take another 4 minutes, according to our simulator. Since conflicts will not affect honest users, most transactions will have very short confirmation times.**  &amp;#x200B;  **Billy-IF**  **a colored coin supply cannot exceed that of all Iota. You could effectively mint a colored coin supply using a smart contract, although there would be performance downsides. There are no plans to increase the supply.** **The convergence to binary will not affect the supply nor anyone's balances.**  &amp;#x200B;  **HusQy\_IOTA**  **Both, Radix and Avalanche have some similarities to IOTA:**  **- Avalanche has a similar voting scheme and also uses a DAG**  **- Radix uses a sharding approach that is similar to IOTAs ""fluid sharding""**  **I don't really consider them to compete with our vision since both projects still rely on fees to make the network work.**  **Centralized solution can however never be feeless and being feeless is not just a ""nice feature"" but absolutely crucial for DLT to succeed in the real world.**  **Having fees makes things a lot easier and Coordicide would already be ""done"" if we could just use fees but I really believe that it is worth ""going the extra mile"" and build a system that is able to be better than existing tech.**",[OWL WATCH] AMA's SUMMARY

741,1,"I have seen a lot communication that iota is feeless but after the below Q and A, I feel whether iota is feeless entirely depends on the market economics and dynamics and not a view that will always hold or be fact. It actually seems misleading to say iota is feeless because it may not always be the case.   The extract is from the Wed 14 Oct 2020 reddit AMA.   ***Question:*** Other than for the good of iota community why would someone have a node when they could have their transactions processes by someone else for free or at no cost to them.   ***Answer from Hans Moog:*** If you are interested in processing incoming payments then you might not want to trust the node of another person to tell you if a transaction was confirmed, so merchants will always have a large enough incentive to run their own nodes to get reliable access to the network. In addition, node operators do not have to give you access to their nodes for free (or even at all). So while it is totally fine for people to use public nodes to issue payments it is always more secure to use your own node to process incoming payments (this can also be an ad-hoc light node).    The response from Hans even raises more questions from me.   1. Why would someone be willing to process public no-direct-interest transactions? Other than NGOs and government and good of community.   2. Are we then hearding to fees being charged for transactions because node owner wants to? Just like Bitcoin, apparently Bitcoin transactions CAN be processed at no fee charge, its just that you have to wait for a long time.   3. Some words used in the response are not assuring and don't give me comfort, it's almost like the network may not be as secure as I thought  - ""... you might not want to trust the node of another person...""  - ""..... it is always more secure to use your own node...""   4. And on another note, I have come to accept that saying  iota will be faster with more transactions is also not exactly honest and may be misleading.   5. I believe iota has a lot of potential and will evolve to a mature network, some ideas will become apparent that they may have been pie in the sky but overall I think this  technology will move us foward.   This is just my view as a learner, constantly asking questions, feel free to correct me and guide me where I am wrong. Am I misunderstanding Hans?",I feel the days of iota being feeless may be numbered

784,1,"**Disclaimer: This is sort of my own arbitrary editing, so there could be some misunderstandings.**  **I root for the spread of good spirits and transparency of IF.**     üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 2:45**  **So why don't we just copy Avalanche? Well that's pretty simple ...**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 2:47**  **1. It doesn't scale very well with the amount of nodes in the network that have no say in the consensus process but are merely consensus consuming nodes** **(i.e. sensors, edge devices and so on). If you assume that the network will never have more than a few thousand nodes then thats fine but** **if you want to build a DLT that can cope with millions of devices then it wont work because of the message complexity.**  **2. If somebody starts spamming conflicts, then the whole network will stop to confirm any transactions and will grind to a halt until the conflict spamming stops.** **Avalanche thinks that this is not a huge problem because an attacker would have to spend fees for spamming conflicts which means that he couldn't do this forever and would at some point run out of funds.**  **IOTA tries to build a feeless protocol and a consensus that stops to function if somebody spams conflicts is really not an option for us.**  **3. If a medium sized validator goes offline due to whatever reason, then the whole network will again stop to confirm any transactions** **because whenever a query for a nodes opinion can not be answered they reset the counter for consecutive successful voting rounds which will prevent confirmations. Since nodes need to open some ports to be available for queries it is super easy to DDOS validators and again bring the network confirmations to 0.**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 3:05**  **4. Avalanche still processes transactions in ""chunks/blocks""** **by only applying them after they have gone through some consensus process (gathered enough successfull voting rounds),** **which means that the nodes will waste a significant amount of time where they ""wait"" for the next chunk to be finished before the transactions are applied to the ledger state. IOTA tries to streamline this process by decoupling consensus and the booking of transactions by using the ""parallel reality based ledger state"" which means that nodes in IOTA will never waste any time ""waiting"" for decisions to be made. This will give us much higher throughput numbers.**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 3:11**  **5. Avalanche has some really severe game theoretic problems where nodes are incentivized to attach their transactions to the already decided parts of the DAG because then things like conflict spam won't affect these transactions as badly as the transactions issued by honest nodes.** **If however every node would follow this ""better and selfish"" tip selection mechanism then the network will stop to work at all.**  **Overall the ""being able to stop consensus"" might not be too bad since you can't really do anything really bad (i.e. double spend) which is why we might not see these kind of attacks in the immediate future but just wait until a few DeFi apps are running on their platform where smart contracts are actually relying on more or less real time execution of the contracts. Then there might be some actual financial gains to be made if the contract halts and we might see alot of these things appear (including selfish tip selection).**  **Avalanche is barely a top 100 project and nobody attacks these kind of low value networks unless there is something to be gained from such an attack. Saying that the fact that its live on mainnet and hasn't been attacked in 3 weeks is a proof for its security is completely wrong.**  **Especially considering that 95% of all stake are controlled by avalanche itself**  **If you control &gt; 50% of the voting power then you essentially control the whole network and attacks can mostly be ignored**  **I guess there is a reason for avalanche only selling 10% of the token supply to the public because then some of the named problems are less likely to appear**  üì∑  **Navin Ramachandran \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 3:21**  **I have to say that wtf's suggestion is pretty condescending to all our researchers. It seems heavy on the troll aspect to suggest that we should ditch all our work because iota is only good at industrial adoption. Does wtf actually expect a response to this? Or is this grand standing?**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 3:22**  **The whole argument of ""why don't you just use X instead of trying to build a better version"" is also a completely idiotic argument. Why did ETH write their own protocol if Bitcoin was already around? Well because they saw problems in Bitcoins approach and tried to improve it.**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 3:27**  u/Navin **Ramachandran \[IF\] Its like most of his arguments ... remember when he said we should implement colored coins in 2nd layer smart contracts instead of the base layer because they would be more expressive (i.e. turing complete) completely discarding that 2nd layer smart contracts only really work if you have a consensus on data and therefore state for which you need the ""traceability"" of funds to create these kind of mini blockchains in the tangle?**  **Colored coins ""enable"" smart contracts and it wouldnt work the other way round - unless you have a platform that works exactly like ETH where all the nodes validate a single shared execution platform of the smart contracts which is not really scalable and is exactly what we are trying to solve with our approach.**  üì∑  **Navin Ramachandran \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 3:28**  **Always easier to criticise than build something yourself. But yet he keeps posting these inflammatory posts.**   **At this point is there any doubt if he is making these comments constructively?**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 3:43**  **If he at least would try to understand IOTAs vision ... then maybe he wouldn't have to ask things like ""Why don't you just copy a tech that only works with fees""**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 4:35**  u/Shaar  &gt;***I thought this would only be used to 'override' finality, eg if there were network splits. But not in normal consensus***   **That is not correct. Every single transaction gets booked on arrival using the parallel reality based ledger state. If there are conflicts then we create a ""branch"" (container in the ledger state) that represents the perception that this particular double spend would be accepted by consensus. After consensus is reached, the container is simply marked as ""accepted"" and all transactions that are associated with this branch are immediately confirmed as well. This allows us to make the node use all of its computing ressources 24/7 without having to wait for any kind of decision to be made and allows us to scale the throughput to its physical limits. That's the whole idea of the ""parallel reality based ledger state"" instead of designing a data structure that models the ledger state ""after consensus"" like everybody else is doing it is tailored to model the ledger state ""before consensus"" and then you just flip a flag to persist your decision. The ""resync mechanism"" also uses the branches to measure the amount of approval a certain perception of the ledger state receives. So if my own opinion is not in line with what the rest of the network has accepted (i.e. because I was eclipsed or because there was a network split), then I can use the weight of these branches to detect this ""being out of sync"" and can do another larger query to re-evaluate my decision.(ÏàòÏ†ïÎê®)**  &gt;***Also what happens in IOTA if DRNG notes would fall out, does the network continue if no new RNGs appear for a while? Or will new nodes be added sufficiently fast to the DRNG committee that no one notices?***   **Its a comittee and not just a single DRNG provider. If a few nodes fail then it will still produce random numbers. And even if the whole comittee fails there are fallback RNG's that would be used instead**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 4:58**  **And multiverse doesn't use FPC but only the weight of these branches in the same way as blockchain uses the longest chain wins consensus to choose between conflicts. So nodes simply attach their transactions to the transactions that they have seen first and if there are conflicts then you simply monitor which version received more approval and adjust your opinion accordingly.**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 5:07**  **We started integrating some of the non-controversial concepts (like the approval reset switch) into FPC and are currently refactoring goshimmer to support this**  **We are also planning to make the big mana holders publish their opinion in the tangle as a public statement, which allows us to measure the rate of approval in a similar way as multiverse would do it**  **So its starting to converge a bit but we are still using FPC as a metastability breaking mechanism**  **Once the changes are implemented it should be pretty easy to simulate and test both approaches in parallel**  üì∑  **Serguei Popov \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 5:53**  &gt;***So the ask is that we ditch all our work and fork Avalanche because it has not been attacked in the month or so it has been up?***   u/Navin **Ramachandran \[IF\] yeah, that's hilarious. Avalanche consensus (at least their WP version) is clearly scientifically unsound.**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 9:43**  u/wtf **maybe you should research avalanche before proposing such a stupid idea**  **and you will see that what I wrote is actually true**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 9:44**  **paying fees is what ""protects"" them atm**  **and simply the fact that nobody uses the network for anything of value yet**  **we cant rely on fees making attack vectors ""inattractive""**  üì∑  **Serguei Popov \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 10:17**  &gt;***well (1.) very obviously the metastability problems are not a problem in practice,***   **putting ""very obviously"" before questionable statements very obviously shows that you are seeking a constructive dialogue**  [ ](https://blog.naver.com/PostList.nhn?blogId=btlkhs&amp;categoryNo=0&amp;from=postList#)üì∑[ ](https://blog.naver.com/PostList.nhn?blogId=btlkhs&amp;categoryNo=0&amp;from=postList#) **(to make metastability work, the adversary needs to more-or-less know the current opinion vectors of most of the honest participants; I don't see why a sufficiently well-connected adversary cannot query enough honest nodes frequently enough to achieve that)**   &gt;***(2.) .... you'd need an unpredictable number every few tens/hundreds milliseconds, but your DRNG can only produce one every O(seconds).***   **the above assumption (about ""every few tens/hundreds milliseconds"") is wrong**   &gt;***We've had this discussion before, where you argued that the assumptions in the FPC-BI paper (incl. ""all nodes must be known"") are not to be taken 100% strictly, and that the results are to be seen more of an indication of overall performance.***   **Aham, I see. So, unfortunately, all that time that I invested into explaining that stuff during our last conversation was for nothing. Again, very briefly. The contents of the FPC-BI paper is not ""an indication of overall performance"". It rather shows (to someone who actually read and understood the paper) why the approach is sound and robust, as it makes one understand what is the mechanism that causes the consensus phenomenon occur.**  &gt;***Yet you don't allow for that same argument to be valid for the ""metastability"" problem in avalanche,***   **Incorrect. It's not ""that same argument"". FPC-BI is a decent academic paper that has precisely formulated results and proofs. The Ava WP (the probabilistic part of it), on the other hand, does** ***not*** **contain proofs of what they call results. More importantly, they don't even show a clear path to those proofs. That's why their system is scientifically unsound.**   &gt;***even when there's a live network that shows that it doesn't matter.***   **No, it doesn't show that it doesn't matter. It only shows that it works when not properly attacked. Their WP doesn't contain any insight on why those attacks would be difficult/impossible.**  üì∑  **Hans Moog \[IF\]Ïñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 10:56**  **That proposal was so stupid - Avalanche does several things completely different and we are putting quite a bit og effort into our solution to pretty much fix all of Avalanches shortcomings**  **If we just wanted to have a working product and dont care about security or performance then we could have just forked a blockchaib**  **I am pretty confident that once we are done - its going to be extremely close to the besttheoretical thresholds that DLTs will ever be able to achieve for an unsharded baselayer**  **‚Äã-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**      üì∑  **BasÏñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§Ï†Ñ 2:43**  **Yesterday I was asked how a reasonably big company no one has heard of could best move forward implementing Access for thousands of locations worldwide. (Sorry for the vagueness, it‚Äôs all confidential.) They read the article and want to implement it because it seems to fit a problem they‚Äôre currently trying to solve. Such moves will vastly increase the utility of protocols like IOTA, and is what the speculation is built on. I do not think you can overestimate what impact Access is going to have. It‚Äôs cutting out the middleman for simple things; no server or service needed. That‚Äôs huge.**  **So yes, I think this space will continue to grow** u/Coinnave  &amp;#x200B;  \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   üì∑  **Angelo Capossele \[IF\]2020.10.02.**  **In short: we are planning a new v0.3.0 release that should happen very soon. This version will bring fundamental changes to the structure of the entire codebase (but without additional features) so that progressing with the development will be easier and more consistent. We have also obtained outstanding results with the dRNG committee managed by the GoShimmer X-Team, so that will also be integral part of v0.3.0. After that, we will merge the Value Tangle with the Message Tangle, so to have only one Tangle and make the TSA and the orphanage easier to manage. And we are also progressing really well with Mana, that will be the focus after the merge. More or less this is what is going to happen this month.**  **We will release further details with the upcoming Research Status Update**  [ ](https://blog.naver.com/PostList.nhn?blogId=btlkhs&amp;categoryNo=0&amp;from=postList#)üì∑[ ](https://blog.naver.com/PostList.nhn?blogId=btlkhs&amp;categoryNo=0&amp;from=postList#)   **‚Äã**","[OWL WATCH] Waiting for ""IOTA TIME"" 30;"

An extensive blog post will clarify any additional open question.***   **Our congestion control mechanism is used to share the network capacity among all nodes.** **The resulting allocation has the great feature of being dynamic,** **which means that available resources are exploited optimally: when the utilization is low, nodes can use the residual capacity to increase their TPS! Moreover, since resources (bandwidth, CPU) are obviously limited, we use mana to make this allocation fair. The opportunity to exploit the unused bandwidth at low cost can also favor malicious nodes trying to congest the network or, worse, to create ledger inconsistencies. Since IOTA is 100% permissionless, the solution to this problem is non-trivial. In our current Coordicide proposal, we have two countermeasures (to be used in combination with the congestion control algorithm): (i) adaptive Proof of Work, an anti spam mechanism, not linked to mana, which prevents a specific node ID from issuing a large burst of messages; (ii) nodes are required to have non zero mana to be able to successfully issue transactions. Please note that both (i) and (ii) have very low thresholds (low PoW difficulty, low mana needed), as they are meant to be used by IoT and low power nodes. Especially in periods of low congestion, we do not exclude the possibility to remove one or both those security countermeasures, but we need first to validate the protocol against all possible attack vectors. Furthermore, we are currently researching a data sharding approach where zero mana nodes are able to issue data transactions. It is also important to say that it will be possible to obtain mana without holding tokens. We will make sure that running a new node will be as easy as possible through the design of an efficient bootstrapping mechanism. So, no worries, IOTA is and will always be feeless and permissionless**   **------------------------------------------------------------------------------------‚Äã**  üì∑  **CoinnaveÏñ¥Ï†ú Ïò§ÌõÑ 11:37**  **Let's forget the price for a sec, how amazing is this news?!

Also, it is impossible for the protocol to differentiate between crap and legitimate uses.** **But, really this shouldn't be a problem.

I was looking into using IOTA technology and I thought it would be cool to build a fully decentralized instant messaging application using the IOTA tangle. I came across IOTA Streams/Channels and I understand I can use this as the protocol to send messages however from what I've read so far in the docs(not much), the message disappears and cannot be stored. I then came across IOTA Chronicle and the idea of Permanodes where you can store and retrieve data in the tangle. Would it be possible to combine these two technologies to create an instant messaging application with the current versions of the tech? Would be great if you are a dev and could give me some pointers and maybe an overview of how you would approach developing an instant messaging app with IOTA.","Question to IOTA devs, can I build an instant messaging application with Chronicle Permanodes and Iota streams/Channels with the current versions?"

One that is collaboratively validated by the economic actors of the world (coporations, companies, foundations, states, people) or one that is validated by an anonymous group of wealthy crypto holders?**  **HusQy**  **The problem with current DLTs is that we use protection mechanisms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake that are inherently hard to shard. The more shards you have, the more you have to distribute your hashing power and your stake and the less secure the system becomes.**  **HusQy**  **Real world identities (i.e. all the big economic actors) however could shard into as many shards as necessary without making the system less secure. Todays DLTs waste trust in the same way as PoW wastes energy.**  **HusQy**  **Is a secure money worth anything if you can't trust the economic actors that you would buy stuff from? If you buy a car from Volkswagen and they just beat you up and throw you out of the shop after you payed then a secure money won't be useful either :P**  **HusQy**  **I believe that if you want to make DLT work and be successful then we need to ultimately incorporate things like trust in entities into the technology.****Examples likes wirecard show that trusting a single company is problematic but** **trusting the economy as a whole should be at ...**  **... least as secure as todays DLTs.****And as soon as you add sharding it will be orders of magnitude more secure.** **DLT has failed to deliver because people have tried to build a system in vacuum that completely ignores things that already exist and that you can leverage on.**  **----------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  **HusQy**  **Blockchain is a bit like people sitting in a room, trying to communicate through BINGO sheets. While they talk, they write down some of the things that have been said and as soon as one screams BINGO! he hands around his sheet to inform everybody about what has been said.**  **HusQy**  **If you think that this is the most efficient form of communication for people sitting in the same room and the answer to scalability is to make bigger BINGO sheets or to allow people to solve the puzzle faster then you will most probably never understand what IOTA is working on.**  **--------------------------------------------------------------------------------**  **HusQy**  **Blockchain does not work with too many equally weighted validators.****If 400 validators produce a validating statement (block) at the same time then only one can survive as part of a longest chain.****IOTA is all about collaborative validation.**  **Another problem of blockchain is that every transaction gets sent twice through the network. Once from the nodes to the miners and a 2nd time from the miners as part of a block.****Blockchain will therefore always only be able to use 50% of the network throughput.**  **And****the last problem is that you can not arbitrarily decrease the time between blocks as it breaks down if the time between blocks gets smaller than the average network delay. The idle time between blocks is precious time that could be used for processing transactions.**  **-----------------------------------------------------------------------------**  **HusQy**  **I am not talking about a system with a fixed number of validators but one that is completely open and permissionless where any new company can just spin up a node and take part in the network.**  **------------------------------------------------------------------------**  **HusQy**  **Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are both centralizing sybil-protection mechanism. I don't think that Satoshi wanted 14 mining pools to run the network.**  **And ""economic clustering"" was always the ""end game"" of IOTA.**  **-----------------------------------------------------------------------------**  **HusQy**  **Using Proof of Stake is not trustless.

958,1,"When we have gone through bubble-like phases with bitcoin and ethereum, there are significantly increased fees and/or slow confirmation times if you don't pay a high enough fee due to competition to be included in the next block. Players with a lot more at stake need to front-run other traders for more lucrative profits and of course are the most willing to pay those high fees.   If we imagine that IOTA is successful and there is a similar type of ""craze"" for applications using IOTA or IOTA itself, and there is a massive amount of activity on the tangle, what will be the limitations? Since there are no fees, and there may be groups incentivized to spam the network during a crunch, who will get their transactions prioritized? My limited understanding of the future features of IOTA lead me to believe that Mana will play a large role in this, but how will this look? Will your confirmation time for your transaction be proportional to your Mana (if you run your own node)? What if you don't run your own node, what determines your place in line if there is a massive amount of volume on the network?",What would a speculation craze or bubble look like on IOTA?

This is incredibly important for several use cases beyond tokenization. In fact, IOTAs upcoming smart contracts will heavily use this new ability to build ""private unforkable blockchains"" ...**  &amp;#x200B;  **... that can only be updated by the owner of the colored coin.

When it comes to tip selection in the absence of an immediate double spend, FPC works by waiting 10 seconds, before considering a transaction to be eligible for tip selection, assuming that even if after 10.1 seconds a conflict would arrive, that most of the network would have seen the same transactions as the first one as** **well and therefore vote for this one to be included anyway.** **This simple mechanism will reduce the chance of messages approving the wrong conflict a lot but not by 100%.

If one device is using more energy than it needs to use, another device can pay for it's excess energy.   \- A decentralized health data sharing platform where health researchers and professionals can share their data with each other for the greater good of health research.

For instance, Bosch could implement IOTA as a standard in all their household appliances which would then ship with a seed and a small amount of preloaded IOTA to ensure data transactions from the second the appliance is connected to the tangle.  Companies wanting to use colored coins would also need to reserve part of the total supply.  If my understanding is correct this would not only ""reserve"" huge amounts of current supply but also result in ""dead money"", ie. IOTAs lost in scrapped hardware or in unused colored coins, which would in turn lead to the need of expanding the total supply.  So, could the IF, theoretically, subdivide 1 IOTA into say 1.000.000 microIOTA or how do you think they would solve a supply problem?",Question: Can 1 iota be subdivided?

Only to people familiar to IOTA, this has a meaning and even then, no one will quickly recognize the exact length of 81 characters.  Other information in QR codes contains a URI, like a web URL, mailto, contact data in VCF, etc. Any QR code scanner will directly know what to do with that information. Even Bitcoin has a URI: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0021  I think that IOTA could also benefit from having a proper URI scheme, like:  iota://pay/address/&lt;address&gt;?tag=&lt;tag&gt;,amount=&lt;amount&gt;  iota://pay/user/..  iota://mam/&lt;address&gt;/read  iota://mam/&lt;address&gt;/post?message=&lt;msg&gt;  iota://listen/&lt;address&gt;  Items in stores could then be provided with tags for automatic payment or reading of a URL with information about the authenticity.  Applications in the IOTA ecosystem can then work seamlessly together, the step to introducing IOTA can be transparent for most users and services can be built on top of IOTA more easily.  The next step would then of course be an exchange format, where distributed wallets can communicate with each other, contact data that can be exchanged over the Tangle, etc.  I think the first step to this would be a clean URI scheme, but I haven't found anything and seeing that the Trinity wallet does not even include this, I doubt that this idea was considered before. I also do not think that the community can define a good scheme, as only the IF knows what's in the pipeline and are at the forefront of standardization.

It then says Generating Address... on the Ledger as if all is working fine, but then reverts to the IOTA app and the Trinity Wallet says: ""Connect Your Ledger.  A Ledger device must be connected in order to complete this function.""  It goes from recognizing it to not recognizing it and exiting the IOTA app on the Ledger then going back in does nothing.  I have also tried disconnecting the Ledger and plugging it back in but it just resets the steps and I have also tried uninstalling the IOTA app and re-installing it on the Ledger as well.  Why is this happening and what can be done in order to retrieve my IOTA?  Thanks",Trinity Wallet Issues Restoring Balance

1318,1,"Basically every colored token is a distorted iota token that have a 'x' value different than the original iota token. Is it really necessary? I don't understand the need for it.   Use case 1:  A bus ticket is represented by the colorful iota coin ""BusTick"". Each IOTA token before being colored was purchased for the price of $ 0.0005 and is now worth $1 as a 'BusTick' token. Over time, each iota token is now worth $ 2 (more than the value of the BusTick token). If the city government of that city wants to add issue more tickets, it will have to buy more iota tokens than it initially paid. It doesn't make sense to me, and the city gov could find more effective ways to do it.  Use case  2:  Renters of a party room have colorful iota tokens that represent how much they own of that property. So every time the place is rented, they are paid in proportion to the amount of these colorful tokens they have. And if they have maintenance expenses, the same thing applies. If they want to sell their party room tokens, they can have an 'x' value for each token given by a real estate agent. This is a better application of tokens than the use case 1, since this property could be divided into many parts and the payment and collection of values could be more easily automated. Still, it's hard to see why token owners should have these colorful tokens? Only the percentage of ownership and the use of common iota tokens are not enough for the real estate company (as iota is feeless and can be used in microtransactions) to pay the party room owners?  My main concerns about iota tokens are exit of supply (every colored token is one less iota token in the system) and less use (weakening the main net) of the original token? Maybe this also means a devaluation of the original token as well.",About colored coins

1403,1,"    **07/05**  **AMA with Dominik Schiener &amp; David Sonstebo, founders of IOTA!**  **davidsonstebo**  **IF is collaborating with a plethora of companies focused on crypto, as well as several crypto-projects that build solutions on top of DLT, for instance out-sourced computation.**  **davidsonstebo**  **We are in active dialog with numerous financial institutions regarding a myriad of new services and business models that the IOTA Tangle enables.The financial sector as a whole is undoubtedly a priority for us and fits like a glove due to IOTA's lack of fees.**  **domschiener**  **I think a lot of that really depends on how much testing is being done by the community over the**  **coming weeks.** **We have tentative timelines of releasing Nectar at the end of Q3, and Honey in Q1**  **2021.****The exciting part is that you - the community - can really play a role in this.**  **domschiener**  **re: Collaboration with other projects.**  **We are actively discussing this with other projects to really extend the functionality of IOTA (for example, anonymous transactions).****You'll hear more about that soon.**  **davidsonstebo**  **We will host a virtual SumSum in the fall,****we are currently planning different events etc. for this**  **domschiener**  **re: JLR Car eWallet.**  **We are still in close contact with them and are actually exploring use cases with them + other partners (for example energy providers). With corona, many of the timelines have sadly been delayed, but we expect this to improve soon.**  **domschiener**  **We are definitely speaking with other mobility companies as well, and are discussing close partnerships.In general, IOTA is the most established permissionless DLT when it comes to mobility, so we are excited to bring real products to the market, especially after Chrysalis**  **davidsonstebo**  **There will always be people who doubt,** **but mathematical proofs don't lie, nor does code; we let that speak for itself. Our team is certainly 100% confident.**  **davidsonstebo**  **For sure, I know some community members have looked into building it before;** **we really look forward to the 'cambrian explosion' that will follow from the network improvements and soon Smart Contract ability.**  **domschiener**  **re: implementing our solution.**  **I think one of the biggest problems which many DLT projects are not aware of is** **the whole problem around system integration. How do I productively integrate a technology like IOTA into my existing systems and create seamless interactions.**  **domschiener**  **We solve this problem by having years of experience working with large companies and understanding their needs. We also have many system integrators as partners (you can see them on our website) who are helping to close this gap.**  **domschiener**  **it's definitely one of the major hurdles for DLT and for IOTA to be productive, but** **we're on a good path especially because we take the industry's feedback into account and shape our engineering roadmap around that.**  **davidsonstebo**  **It's very hard for me to pick just one of those, those 8 are faaaar from exhaustive in terms of industries that IOTA can disrupt or improve. For brevity's sake:** **anything that involves data or transactions ought to involve IOTA**  **domschiener**  **re: migration with Chrysalis.**  **We are introducing breakign changes on the protocol, which means that users will have to change from the current signature / address scheme to the new one.But this will be as simple as issuing a transaction. Our wallet will do all the heavy lifting.**  **domschiener**  **re: tokenization standard.**  **Absolutely!** **We are already speaking with partners which token standards we can introduce when using the IOTA platform to tokenize your real estate, equity, mobility fleets, etc.**  **domschiener**  **standardization is an important part of all of our work, and we will keep that in mind with smart contracts and tokenization**  **davidsonstebo**  **re: partners feedback on Chrysalis and Pollen;**  **they are very enthused. A lot of them has been eagerly awaiting this before devoting more resources, as they naturally want to build on the real architecture**  **domschiener**  **re: standard by the end of the year.**  **Our entire engineering process has been improved by introducing a clear RFC and specification process.****You can already see this with Bee (I recommend you to look at the repo).** **Creating an official standard takes time though.**  **domschiener**  **re: regulations up ahead.**  **I think** **what really needs to happen more is****that the crypto industry and the tech experts** **start speaking more with the regulators.****I really hope that** **by engaging with INATBA and the Digital Chamber of Commerce that we can be a voice for the industry**  **domschiener**  **in particular questions around legal, tax, accounting and storage for dealing with crypto-currencies need to be clearly defined.**  **davidsonstebo**  **The time for ternary is not now, while the time for IOTA is most certainly \*now\*, so we adjusted our roadmap.By shifting to binary, we make IOTA a lot more efficient immediately due to the decades of legacy support for binary. It also makes the development faster.**  **domschiener**  **IOTA in 5 years will be an established digital infrastructure layer, which will be the backbone of an**  **enormous new economy (Machine Economy and beyond). Once the network is fully decentralized next week,** **we really expect a cambrian explosion of new IOTA DApps and products.**  **davidsonstebo**  **re: standardization.**  **I don't think any other project is as far along with their specification and standardization efforts as IOTA.****We consider it pivotal for world wide adoption.** **Collaboration with open source organizations, standard bodies and companies is our strategy**  **domschiener**  **Standardization certainly helps with adoption and it is key for certain industry applications (e.g. data interoperability).But we also are already seeing large companies being the pioneers of their industry and building the first products.**  **domschiener**  **after Coordicide there are some very exciting topics to look at, such as sharding and optimization of the new IOTA network.And then there's also applications on top of IOTA / DApps etc.****There will be enough work**  **domschiener**  **we truly envision IOTA to be the backbone of a new economy, powered by feeless microtransactions**  **davidsonstebo**  **re:** **AI + Tangle,**  **it was always embedded into the DNA of IOTA and there's numerous efforts by the community as well as ourselves in terms of research and potential.****Btw, CFB was never involved in introducing that to IOTA. I'm confident that this symbiosis will emerge naturally**  **domschiener**  **We do have an upper TPS limit today.** **The Chrysalis improvements which will come end of July will push the network beyond 1000 TPS stable on the mainnet. With Coordicide and sharding implemented, we don't see any upper limits.**  **domschiener**  **re: smart contract necessity.**  **We have definitely refined the scope of Smart Contracts to bring it to the market faster and drastically increase the use cases enabled by IOTA.We for example also have IOTA Access now,****which will be the future of access control for embedded devices**  **davidsonstebo**  **Oracles will emerge naturally. Given that IOTA is the perfect layer for immutable data, the two concepts are made for each other.**  **domschiener**  **re: cloud provider.**  **We're already talking with several cloud providers to integrate IOTA, so that companies and users can easily spin up nodes directly from the dashboard!**  **domschiener**  **re: most important thing from the community.**  **Get involved! IOTA is nothing without its amazing community and its ecosystem which is building around it. Especially now with the Pollen network, we need as much involvement and feedback from the community as possible.****We are truly creating this future of IOTA together.**  **domschiener**  **re: exchange listing payments.**  **Absolutely not, we have never played the Pay to Play game which others have.**  **davidsonstebo**  **re: funding of IF,**  **we have several different revenue streams. The iota reserve is still a significant part of covering costs, but by 2021 IF should be self-sustaining without relying on the tokens**  **davidsonstebo**  **re: regulatory concerns.**  **We decided from day 1 to go through the slow and steady (and much harder) route from day 1** **by incorporating the organization in Germany, this ethos is still embedded in the organization. We work with regulators all the time, so no big concern**  **domschiener**  **re: what's coming next for us.**  **1) A highly scalable and reliable mainnet, with less than 10 second confirmation times. 2) The continuation of the fully decentralized testnet with incentives paid out to the community, 3) more adoption not just in industry, but also DeFi etc.**  **domschiener**  **re: US vs. European partners.**  **Today I would say** **more than 70% of our partners are in the EU. Which is very exciting, as we haven't explored the US yet.We do have companies like Dell who we're working with, but over the coming months that will certainly increase! Same with Asia.**  **davidsonstebo**  **In the early days there was definitely a major focus on becoming the leading DLT in Europe, which I'd say we have succeeded with. In the last year we've gained a lot of US adoption as well and allocate more resources there. US adoption will certainly skyrocket soon**  **domschiener**  **Europe was an excellent testground for us to prove what the Foundation can do, what the possible use cases are, and for our technology to mature. In the next phase we are able to on board companies more quickly and work with them on clear products.**  **domschiener**  **Currently we have 110 team members in the Foundation.**  **domschiener**  **one word:** **DApps! We are already doing that now with the Pollen Testnet****(you can build DApps**  **there already), and** **this will only increase with Chrysalis (where we will have a Smart Scripting**  **Language) and Smart Contracts.**  **davidsonstebo**  **securing data and enabling m2m payments. We are already working with semiconductors such as ST Microelectronics on this**  **domschiener**  **I think one of the main things** **that is lacking in Germany is the involvement of the government. While we are in contact with the government, I think there is a lot more we can do (for example testbeds). I hope that will improve soon.**  **davidsonstebo**  **The Avalanche whitepaper is riddled with red flags and their leader is showing concerning behavior.****Not a fan, despite them copying some of our concepts, which is always a compliment**  **domschiener**  **re: specification.**  **We are nearly done with all the coordicide (Honey) specifications - including Mana. We are working on refining them now with Pollen and will publish them to the community soon**  **domschiener**  **The entire research team has been working on the specifications for the last months**  **domschiener**  **why not setup both nodes? Pollen and Hornet?** **Both of them don't require that much resources and will support the networks.If you want to test out what the future of IOTA looks like, you should definitely play around in the Pollen network.**  **domschiener**  **Hashgraph is definitely not a competitor, as they have a completely different business model (for profit) and network (permissioned).**  **domschiener**  **there is no requirement on the number of nodes - the more the better of course!**  **domschiener**  **We already have an integration with Hyperledger, and we are definitely pushing forward with interoperability(you will learn more about an exciting research project at the end of the month)**  **domschiener**  **Stronghold is the name of the wallet library, which will have strong cryptographic proofs and safety**  **(including hardware). It will be the backbone of the future IOTA wallet.**  **davidsonstebo**  **an addendum on the topic of misunderstood:** **A lot of uninformed individuals seem to hold this false belief that IOTA is ""purely experimental"", whereas in reality we have an army of professors, PhD and academic institutions working on every aspect of it.**  **domschiener**  **re: Q1 production readiness.**  **The exciting part about our strategy is that many of the Coordicide concepts are already being introduced to the IOTA mainnet with Chrysalis. Which means that the core software (Bee and Hornet) will be battle tested over the coming months.**  **domschiener**  **We expect to be fully ready in Q1. In fact, our big objective for this year is to make IOTA enterprise ready and meet the demands and requirements from the industry.**  **domschiener**  **re: Testbed in Africa.**  **It's definitely one of the most exciting projects in our history and it is continuing well! We expect to have a fully functional supply chain testbed setup there, and be part of the supply chain process.**  **domschiener**  **re: Trondheim.**  **The CityxChange program (funded by the European Commission) will continue until 2022 / 2023, we've already made some great progress and I think that more results will be shared soon. It's been awarded as a flagship project by the European Commission.**  **domschiener**  **We are 100% confident in Coordicide, and that we will be able to deliver**  **davidsonstebo**  **re: whether Coordicide can fail.**  **Not at all**  **domschiener**  **We sadly don't dictate when our partners can publish news - it really depends on them.** **We have**  **just started the new development (expansion) of the project some 4 - 6 weeks ago.**  **\[about Africa testbed\]**  **domschiener**  **Fiware: We just started a webinar series with some municipalities in Germany.** **With Chrysalis being finalized, we will definitely work on a full integration with Fiware, right now it is a bit too early.**  **domschiener**  **re: price correlation.**  **Sadly, this is a problem for all of crypto, since BTC is sort of the ""gateway"" to it all.** **I do hope that with more well established financial players entering the scene, that this dependency will diminish. But I sadly have no timeline in mind.**  **domschiener**  **re: incentives.**  **We will publish more on that soon. But** **you will be rewarded for finding bugs / attack vectors, and we will also distribute awards for participation.**  **davidsonstebo**  **re: incentivized testnet.**  **We are currently exploring some really exciting ways to setup rather ""game changing"" incentives,** **but regrettably I cannot disclose any details.**  **domschiener**  **we are not personally involved in development and coding (which is a good thing! lol). Purely**  **management / strategy.** **We have one of the best, most experienced and passionate teams in this**  **space, so I'm really happy to work alongside them.**  **davidsonstebo**  **Neither I or Dom are involved in the actual coding anymore. I'll just echo what Dom said:** **we have built a team comprised of the best of the best, so our role these days is to empower, support and guide them to the best of our ability**  **domschiener**  **we can't do pre-announcements haha. But** **we are working on exciting projects where you can actually use and earn IOTA tokens, real world cases with the industry, and some exciting extensions to IOTA's functionality beyond micropayments and data.**  **domschiener**  **I think** **the engineering department is around 35 - 40 people. Then there's around 15 researchers**  **domschiener**  **re: rewards for node operators.**  **There will be no intrinsic rewards in the protocol, but** **with the introduction of DApps you can be paid for example to store data from others, or to process information (Smart Contracts).**  **domschiener**  **I would say that it has a lot to do with integration time and cost.** **With Chrysalis, we think that this**  **will drastically improve and hopefully IOTA will be listed on some of the other large exchanges.**  **domschiener**  **I think** **in the future the IOTA Foundation will really establish itself as a ""think tank"" and leader on data privacy, monetization, digital trust and digital identity. We will continue to develop software, but we will also work more on advising governments and corporations.**  **domschiener**  **You will see many great improvements and use cases coming up over the coming weeks, so definitely stay tuned on our exciting progress!**  **domschiener**  **this is definitely the most exciting time in our history, and we and the community can truly feel the**  **progress and the impact which our work has.**",[AMA hosted by CMC (with Dom/David)] Readable 'Summary '

1460,1,"I am very interested into this project, but there is one thing I can't quiet wrap my head around: Lost seeds.  In cryptospace right now, a lost seed equals lost funds - I'm aware. Thinking into the future afaik a plan of IF is to also have proof of ownership of things build into the ledger (house, stocks, think of digital twins and so on). Outside of crypto, if you lost your credit card, your car/house.keys, your passport, there are ways for you to retrieve it by contacting the according comapanys/offices.  How would such a scenario play out in a tangle-world? If I had my proof of ownership of a house in the tangle and I lost the seed, will noone ever be able to gain ownership over it ever again? Will there spawn a second twin of an analog object in the tangle? Do we need intermediates (which the goal was to get rid of to begin with). Would people use bank accounts if they knew there money gets locked, when they lose the PIN to ther account? Did I miss somethng or is this problem already solved?  The only solution that I can think of is intermediates - someone that is controlling your seed and only gives you access to parts of your fund after authorization checks - like a banking institution.",How will lost seeds be handled in the future?

If i again want to recharge my wallet A , i would need new address. (Found some where it is not advised to reuse the address) , I guess a new address is auto generated in wallet A ?  And the address has to be manually in the exchange right ?   d) Is there a direct exhange to trinity wallet implementation?

Because if one day a big news appear with a title like ""Your car probably is helping terrorism !!!!!!! :O"", with the follow reasoning: Your care use the tangle to send data, this up the  scalability of the tangle network, a terrorism organization is using the tangle to send data anonymously around the world. So in theory you'r helping this organization to send this illegal data around the world. Here is a terrorism group but this work with any illegal organization.  A good why to avoid this is to split tangle networks and make a network for each usage. Where any one in the network can decide I support this tangle network so i store on my personal permanode this network. If each network is made to perfectly fit for this usage, this increase the difficulty to make an illegal usage. In this case illegal use of the tangle are not prevented but each one can choose to support it or not.  Sorry for my english, i'm helping me with google translate.

1548,1,"Nutrition science is inherently unreliable. It's near enough impossible to run a life-long randomised controlled trial with a large data set of test subjects and force them to follow strict dietary guidelines.  So nutrition scientists resort to observational studies which rely heavily on epidemiological food surveys/questionnaires to gather data, but as people are forgetful and inconsistent, the subsequent data collected is low quality and sometimes wildly inaccurate.  Here's where IOTA comes in. Willing participants could sign up to a new type of trial, providing only survey-relevant data (age, sex, BMI e.t.c) that could be authenticated using identity verification on the tangle. Then a smart contract would randomly assign participants to  certain group subsets using the above criteria and in accordance to what the study was looking for.  As this study would be a paid, we shall assume that there would be a large enough pool of willing participants for this to be viable. Essentially, users would get paid via a microtransaction for each meal recorded. This could be done via a smartphone app (bar/QR code scanning, object recognition software via camera e.t.c). Taking this one step further we could use machine learning to predict meals based on ingredients purchased at the supermarket/patterns of behaviour, and there could be some sort of favourites menu to assimilate and record frequently eaten meals to save time.  Granted, this isn't practical to do all of the time so we can expect a range of quality of data input. So to encourage consistent input, participants could be ranked into 3 groups (rare trackers &lt;33% of days inputted, inconsistent trackers 33-66%, and consistent trackers &gt;66%) and incentivised with more reward money for quality data input.  You can imagine the resulting data would be of a much higher quality than conventional food questionnaires and therefore be much more lucrative. In addition, if this was combined with additional data from wearables (smart watches e.t.c) the resulting data-set would be of huge interest to governments and health nutritionists around the world. We could start to begin to resolve some of the most heated and hotly contested topics in nutrition science, such as the efficacy of certain diets (vegan/high-fat/low-fat e.t.c), and links to long-term degenerative diseases, auto-immune conditions and allergies.  Another interesting point is that there seems to be a linear relationship between food tracking and weight loss as suggested by this 2017 study. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5568610/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5568610/)  Perhaps the simple act of recording what we eat is enough to make noticeable and positive changes to our diet that could end up paying for itself.

Users earn cryptocurrency in real-time by consuming    content produced by other users, maintaining their own personal blog as    well as sharing great content.  The   easiest way to explain Publish0x is that Publish0x is a crypto    agnostic publishing platform similar to Medium, where both author and    reader earn.  How to Earn Crypto by Publishing AND Reading Content on Publish0x?:  Publish0x   is a crypto-agnostic platform through which content  publishers AND   their readers can earn crypto. When you publish content,  your readers   can tip you. Tips are free and come from Publish0x rewards  pool! A tip   is split between author and reader.  * **1-Earn Crypto by Reading:**  You   don't need any crypto currency already to use the platform,  infact,   both the author and the reader earns on Publish 0x - yes you  earn   cryptocurrency while you read!  How it works is that it gives you  the   tip and you choose how much to allocate to the author and how much  to   keep! Just look for this sliding tipper at the bottom of every post    after you have logged in.  * **2-Earn Crypto by Blogging:**  While   anyone can register, read and give tips to authors on  Publish0x,   currently the only way to become a publisher is to make a  simple   application to become an author, or to get a direct invite from  the   Publish0x team.

I have not been active in a long time so I did not pay attention to what happened and what I need to do to protect myself. Crucify me, I know, I deserve it. I'm hoping there are some gracious people who might instruct me on what to do today. I have since read a little and it sounds like you may be fine if you didn't open up Trinity between x date and y date. I really can't tell when the last time I opened it was so I'm unsure if I am affected. I'm nervous on how to proceed. I would hate to accidentally do something now to hurt myself, so I haven't opened up Trinity out of fear. Here are my details: I have Trinity, no idea which version, no idea when I last opened it. If you put a gun to my head and told me to guess, I would say I last opened it in late 2019, but cannot say for sure. There are two ap icons an my desktop, one is ""Trinity"" (IOTA symbol with black background) and one is ""IOTA Wallet"" (IOTA symbol with no background). Is the ""IOTA Wallet"" the old one? Assuming that just needs to be removed? I have a Ledger Nano S. I believe the keys are stored on the Nano. So, where do I go from here? Download latest Trinity and all is good? Or is there more to it? Anything in particular need to be done with the Nano? I have gotten some great help here in the past. I'll put out my greatest thank yous in advance to anyone willing to help again this time.

Q: i see that argument for critical data (Health/finance/very personal info etc.) however, i dont really see it for ""trivial"" info such as temperature / waste bin info etc. wouldnt ""ordinary"" security measures suffice in those cases?       2) do we really Need ""pay per xy"" for everything?    \- pay internet per min/GB? we had that and i dont Need it back   \- pay per minute for parking: personally, i dont see the Advantage. e.g. the cost rises every 30mins. well, some days you park 57m and pay as much as for 31m, some days you park 63m and pay as much as you had to to park 88m. win some/lose some, it Levels out.

1781,1,"Ok, usually I get down voted when I post ideas in most any sub.  So prepare to be wasting your time or prep yourself to read really bad writing I don‚Äôt know.  I occasionally dream up ideas involving the tangle.  Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt give myself the time to apply a lot of effort towards anything real as I‚Äôm usually just constantly day dreaming.  Either way, the problem that always comes up is user authentication.  A lot of big things could be done if a person could be authenticated as a sincere individual.  Aka not a duplicate account, spam bot.    I see the tangle as a way to secure and track the records relative to those accounts.  The solution could have options like private identity/public identity for various purposes but basically it never allows a user to double use themselves (opinions)or falsify their intentions.   A few of the ideas that need this: ( in the case these are novel ideas, they are all free to use and consider this a Creative Commons declaration or whatever)  - recycling platform, thinking can returns but eventually bigger.  Basically the recycling companies trust that your giving them clean sorted raw materials because your name is tied to it (public identity required).  You can now recoup your money on returnable without hauling them to the store.    -opinion platform, basically like voting but just a place to weigh in your opinion on anything - legitimately and one time.  This could allow global consensus on wide spread issues humanity faces.  Ie (global warming is real/fake)   -news platform, basically like opinions but related to breaking news.  This allows people to vote on the legitimacy of the content in the articles.  Posters gain reputation scores over the validity/neutrality/novel ness of the content.  Again, single accounts   A few implementation ideas: again free to use,  - backlinking social media accounts to verify non-spammy consistent use.  Identity is tied to those accounts ‚Äòinvisibly‚Äô somehow.  Downfall - users could have multiple accounts- but it could be hard to have dozens for the common user.  Not sure about malicious users of mass intent.  -cross verifying accounts in person.  Maybe you and three or four of your friends take pictures of each other and verify that your really there.  The photos taken are securely encrypted and stored on the tangle.  An algorithm labels your biometric features and when an account is created at say 99% match to your photo the algorithm triggers to need something more from these users to verify authenticity further.   -Not my favorite but scan country issued state ids.  Similar to above.  Perhaps a combination of all the above?  I would love to be able to help on these but I have very minimal programming skills.  And a lot of chores in life that I let prevent me from making large strides.",Problem I‚Äôd like to solve

1812,1,"[Pickert GMBH on digital twins](http://t.ly/L79f):  &gt; We believe that the data should belong to the party that produces the products because they have the IP and the knowledge what has to be tracked in order to manufacture defect-free products.  Let me reiterate that:  &gt; We believe that **the data should belong to the party that produces the products** because they have the IP and the knowledge what has to be tracked in order to manufacture defect-free products.  This statement should be fairly concerning to any follower of IOTA as it seems to be completely at odds with the IF's stance on privacy.  Once IOTA is standardized and their corporate partners start implementing this protocol in all of their products, consumers can expect to have any number of these IOTA serving products in their home, auto and personal effects.  Let's say that I'm an enterprising mogul interested in gathering and selling people's data. For a fairly reasonable license fee to Pickert, Jaguar, VW, etc, I can get access to their streams. (Of course those companies would sell access to those streams; why wouldn't they?) I bring that data in, cross-analyze and correlate with public records available from DMV, county, state and federal sources. Within a fairly small margin of error, I can pinpoint the person, their likes, dislikes, where they go and what they do.  I then pull a Cambridge Analytica and sell the pertinent data to political parties, authoritarian governments, advertisers, etc for a fairly large profit.  All of this without access to your personal or private IOTA streams. No need to break encryption. Just pay for access.  Considering I'm just a normal guy seeing the possibilities of this, I am 100% sure the very smart people at IOTA and their partner corporations are well aware of the possibilities for abuse.  So, I would like to ask for an explanation (ELI5, please), on why my concerns are out of proportion to the reality, or how the IF intend to keep this type of data mining from happening.  If the answer is, 'it can't be stopped', then great. Anyone want to start a business with me?  Edit: The only possible solution I see would be for the GDPR to be amended to forbid the sale of stream data by product manufacturers. And, I guess, the GDPR would have to be adopted worldwide.

Our idea if it works out is to show a simple IOTA transaction . for small purchases from local book store as a start .      I am not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask those questions , if not would be great if you could direct us to the right subreddit .  1. Is the trinity wallet the only way to purchase IOTAs? If i understand it correctly this is like a top up account , where one can buy IOTAs corresponding to USD or EUR ? Perhaps i am wrong.      2. It seems trinity wallet , is the customer facing app ?      3.  For a successful transaction to happen , one needs to install the wallet both on the seller and purchase side ?  Any transaction between seller and purchaser would be totally free .      4. The only fee that would occur is the would be i the purchase of the IOTAs . if i understand it correctly.      5. In a nutshell , any device can act as a transaction entity in IOTA as long it is connected into the internet , has a unique digital ID and has IOTA wallet ?      We want to start with a simple  app from the user side and book store side to do a transaction and show how much one can save instead of an equivalent transaction .  I guess there are already some implementation of such basic features?      It would be great if one could direct us to implemented modules so we can do a simple proof of concept . it would be really cool , if it could be adopted by more and more people and small businesses.",IOTA for small businesses ?

1836,1,I just wanted to make this post to ask if anyone knew of projects in the Iota ecosystem (or any other blockchain/DLT) that are attempting to create decentralised cloud services? Or maybe edge services would be a more appropriate name.  I know that there was a few people trying to create decentralised storage services using distributed hash tables on computers people use. This is definitely the most feasible option to implement.   I'm more curious if anyone is working on actual compute instances using VMs or other containers and allowing people to be paid using tokens. Similarly to AWS's EC2 service.  I feel with the new smart tokens being announced for Iota it's only a matter of time that we'll see a range of new ideas out there.

For instance, How could an app like Apple Pay or Venmo (or any other app that allows for instant, feeless digital fiat transfers between users already) become integrated with the current Jaguar Land Rover 'earn as you drive' project so that valuable data streams collected by the car can at any time be deposited into your checking account as a fiat currency?  Would this just be a simple tweak to Trinity to allow banks to directly accept native tokens at their market conversion rate?  If this is worth answering to any of you highly intelligent community members, I would be very grateful for a response :)",Can anyone explain to me role the that banks/NFC payment apps will play in the adoption of the Iota token?

For example your location, browsing history, shopping habits etc. Lets assume Google will suddenly decide to pay for such personal information (even though they could collect it for free for decades).  Will the ability to receive IOTA in your personal wallet require KYC authentication, like Brave? If so, wouldnt it make the whole privacy even worse, since now big data companies can associate more or less anonymous data to an exact person?  With Brave, people prefer to keep their privacy rather than giving all their personal information for a few $ per year.","Will selling your personal data to Google, VW etc. for IOTA require KYC verification?"

1985,1,"&gt; **Lewis Freiberg** in #announcements  &gt; Hey @everyone! &gt;  &gt; We are setting up a new initiative to improve the experience when working with or on IOTA. Our primary focus at IOTA has always been adoption - and all of that starts with the developer experience. Moving forward, we want to make sure that every product launch, new release or upgrades follow a quality standard, which includes full documentation, code examples and Proof of Concepts and a team of developers willing.  &gt;  &gt; We strive to be the project with the best developer experience in the DLT space, on par with other well established Open-Source projects. With this effort to significantly improve and standardize the developer experience we will not only help our existing ecosystem, but we will also attract new developers outside of our community to build with IOTA. &gt;  &gt; IOTA was born as a community project, and our vibrant community has made IOTA the great project that it is today. As such, we are forming teams (working groups) around each of the products in IOTA's ecosystem (e.g. GoShimmer, Streams, Access, Identity, Bee, Hornet, etc.), composed of IF members and community developers. We collaborate in those teams to ensure a high standard of tooling and documentation at launch, as well as continued support thereafter. &gt;  &gt; Some of the activities will include:  &gt; - Early testing of new releases  &gt; - Providing direct feedback to product development &gt; - Developing and testing code examples/tutorials before release &gt; - Giving feedback on and improving documentation  &gt; - Provide suggestions on RFP‚Äôs (Request for Proposals) for EDF grants &gt; - Being an advocate for IOTA's developer community &gt;  &gt; We have created a public channel on Discord #experience where those who are interested can participate. Goal is to get as much input from the community on this initiative as possible and to then officially elect members into the working groups to drive the growth and developer experience of IOTA forward. &gt; To learn more about these teams you can check out their charter on the IOTA Community Github: https://github.com/iota-community/iota-experience-team &gt;  &gt; If you are interested in getting involved in the working groups please fill out this form: https://forms.gle/UZ5kLBUDti3xDCFp9",IOTA Experience Team Initiative

I would really like if they got answered (preferably from David :)).  1) CFB states that Iota won't be quantum proof. Is this true?  2) What will happen to Jinn and all the knowledge about hardware? Will this be used in the future?  3) Will Iota be going trinary in the future? Is it possible to upgrade? Is IF even interested to go trinary?  4) What can we expect from CFB's fork? Financial and technical?  And after reading David's and CFB's talk I must way that I fully understand David. CFB Just didn't want to negotiate. He should at least tell David why does he need trinary Iota this year.   I hope David or anyone else is capable of giving me some answers.,IOTA and future plans?

2023,1,"TLDR; IOTA has the best chance among other crypto projects to massively disrupt tech  Ok, so I'm certainly not the oldest person in Crypto but I've been perusing and poking different crypto projects for at least 4 years now and I've coalesced around IOTA and developed an aversion to general ""Crypto"".     Around 3 years ago we saw the rise of Ethereum.  This was a glorious moment for Crypto.  Yes the value of crypto skyrocketed but the truth; which some still don't see, is this was the first real chance for Crypto to have a mainstream place in daily tech.  Ethereum's smart contracts were honestly the only reasonable application Crypto could provide the general populace and it had massive disruptive potential.  I will not waste time discussing stores of value of BTC or anonymous txns because the truth is the application for these just hasn't taken hold.  With Ethereum's success Crypto in general jumped which was the first time I came to understand the propaganda around Crypto and how those pushing projects like BTC were either misinformed or cared very little about the tech and are only in it for profit.  Naive me...  This glorious moment saw the creation of numerous smart contract projects including the most successful smart contract application CryptoKitties bringing with it the inevitable collapse of Ethereum.  I should have seen this coming.  I understood the tech but I was just too excited to think reasonably.  CryptoKitties shut down the Ethereum blockchain.  We need to think about that for a bit.  Basically, the Ethereum platform could not support it's core competency (Smart Contracts) and there it was.  Read from the threads what you want but no project that I could see other than Ethereum had a chance at anything reasonable in Crypto and even that shit the bed.  We were willing to accept a non-scaling, fee fluctuating piece of garbage just for Smart Contracts.  After this I was not interested in any Crypto project that didn't have a fundamentally different platform from Blockchain which could solve the infamous trilemma problem.  &amp;#x200B;  As an aside there were a few projects outside of IOTA I had my eye on.  Maidsafe, Opacity (formerly Oyster), nano.  Looking back on that small list I realize how limited my view of Crypto was as well as how little anyone can really ever know about these projects.  Maidsafe is older than Bitcoin and is still trying to boil the ocean... it doesn't seem to be working.  Oyster was a massive scandal by its founder and is now not even decentralized go figure.  Nano is a one trick pony and is not a platform anyone can reasonably develop on.  &amp;#x200B;  IOTA was the obvious pivot for me and many others in Crypto who cared about application and wanted to find a project in the Crypto space with true potential.  As the dust settled after the Crypto flop of 2017 IOTA surfaced as the only promising project.  This was still hard to see though.  So many of us had been bamboozled by Crypto projects.  Distinguishing IOTA as not a ""scam"" was harder than people might expect and oh boy was there FUD.  Any chance someone would get to sling mud at IOTA they would.  It still blows my mind when I think about it.  It seemed like more people wanted IOTA to fail than they wanted Bitcoin to succeed.  No one wanted to consider that traditional blockchain was dead; they still don't.  Let me be clear, traditional blockchain is dead... its dead tech.  Stop trying to patch it, don't introduce another bip stop giving a shit about it.  Block chain does not scale, Ethereum will not work either.  I'm sorry it won't.  If it does it will be after they've completely abandoned blocks in the traditional sense and explain to me how that's possible while continuing to run a blockchain.  They are putting effort into trying to solve a problem that they could just avoid by starting over on a different platform.  Expect Vitalik to leave the project before this happens.  He knows more than anyone that Blockchain is dead.  He would hate to admit it but nothing he ever touches can catch IOTA.  I am not the 2017 ignorant Crypto enthusiast anymore, I am the tempered realist and Ethereum's future doesn't exist.  We should let it die like we should let Bitcoin die.  This might be hard to accept but get over it.  Put your feelings aside and move on.  &amp;#x200B;  The Irony of the FUD against IOTA is that no one copied the tech and it has no direct competitors only apparitions of the past that haunt us on Reddit.  Moaning things like ""Dooon't rolll your owwwn cryptoooo"",  We don't see IOTA lite or IOTA cash or IOTA gold so maybe we should thank the haters?  On second thought fuck em'.  I could create a post nearly twice as long as this talking about IOTA FUD.  The point to be made here is that during the last few years it would have been so difficult for any Crypto enthusiast to embrace IOTA with all the bad press.  In addition, up until 2018 IOTA was the best Crypto platform to support a future tech which wasn't here yet.  &amp;#x200B;  So, here I was, excited about IOTA but not really excited about IOT in general.  I didn't ""get"" it.  Yes I understand it but it wasn't solving a problem we have now.  We already have a solution that we have yet to fully implement and that's smart contracts.  Right now software companies can act as middlemen and reap profits with no overhead.  Why do we need an AirBnB, Uber, eBay?  Smart Contracts guts these worthless entities and gives the wealth back to the individuals making the transactions.  Vitalik got the problem right but proposed the wrong solution.  &amp;#x200B;  So, Q2 2018 comes along and with it Qubic.  The only thing I cared about was that IOTA was getting smart contracts.  I didn't care about the hardware.  I didn't care about Jinn or trinary or whatever.  I wanted Smart Contracts on the tangle.  Here they were!.. kind of.  As I dug deeper which was absolutely required since this was not at all trivial I realized that we needed hardware and oracles to implement these smart contracts.  I just assumed that due to IOTA's platform this was a necessity because lord knows if they could make smart contracts without having to create trinary chips and oracles they would have tried that first...  &amp;#x200B;  In a way my ignorance and faith saved me.  I don't know how happy I would have been if I had known they could create smart contracts without all these other steps first.  I would have gotten impatient.  So I had mixed feelings when I heard about CFB's shenanigans and that IOTA was going to attempt a more traditional Smart Contract implementation.  I am more pumped than ever but more disappointed than ever.  Why the hell would they not have canned this douche earlier?  Do they not understand what they are sitting on?  Why are they squandering their time solving a problem (IOT) that doesn't exist yet without prioritizing the next real solution (smart contracts).  There are probably many things I don't understand here but I do understand one thing.  DO NOT FOLLOW PEOPLE.  Satoshi is not your savior, Vitalik is not your savior, CFB, Sonstebo, Dominik, Popov will all fail you at some point.  The project is the real foundation.  It is the thing that doesn't get corrupted.  It is the things these individuals coalesce around.  They know deep down what they have and they won't give it up.  So the lesson is don't measure the individual, measure the product.  &amp;#x200B;  Aight, so I've basically laid out the punch line for you.  IOTA; the best platform in crypto existence, that's solved the trilemma (with coordicide) will also be implementing Smart Contracts.  This isn't an exaggeration.  It is the next step for Crypto.  Either this works and the Crypto community can slough off its past delusions and look forward or it doesn't work and we continue to wait.  Hopefully, we get it right this time.",Feelings toward *new* Smart Contracts

2031,1,"With the recent publication of the talks between David and CFB, the latter threatened to fork IOTA.  Back in 2017, the question was already asked and David answered : *‚ÄòNot in the blockchain manner, no. IOTA is made to actually work as an entirely decentralized permissionless network, not be a politically clusterfuck of infinite crypto-federal-reserves.‚Äô*  Others sources suggest that it might be possible to fork IOTA even do the task is quite challenging. It was even suggested that IOTA already had a fork (Aidos Kuneen token). After checking it, it is a copy/paste of IOTA‚Äôs code and every mention of IOTA was replaced by ADK.   1) So the question is in the table : Can iota be forked?  Also, after reading the convo between David/CFB, do you think that this whole thing make sense?  More than 70% of the conversation was David running after CFB and try to reason with him. While CFB was answering like a bot with a predetermined set of words randomly picked including ‚Äòsuing you‚Äô ‚Äòthey slow me down‚Äô I want trinary‚Äô ‚Äòlawyers‚Äô ‚Äòdo as I said‚Äô ‚Äòfork‚Äô  2) Why is David running after him like that? Why is he spending so much energy to try to reason with him? Does he really need him?  I think that David acted nicely and he opened many times the door for CFB. His points were making also lot of sense. But every time that CFB was reading binary, he was really losing it.  3) that doesn‚Äôt make sense to me. Either he is sick, really crazy, either there is something else. What do you think? Is CFB completely crazy? Is this whole thing completely set up?  4) To keep up on that : what‚Äôs the point for CFB to release all this conversation? It‚Äôs only negative stuff that display his worst side. He didn‚Äôt say a single positive stuff : he is way too smart for this world, people are way to dumb for him (so slowing him down), people have to (as he said) ‚Äòbend the knee‚Äô for him, it should be ‚Äòas he said‚Äô end of the question etc. That‚Äôs truly horrible way of thinking and totally incompatible with a productive work within a company/foundation environnement. Why did he release that? What was the point that he was trying to make?  tl;dr :   i) Can IOTA be forked?  ii) Why David is running after CFB?  iii) Why is CFB acting like that?  iv) What is the point that CFB tries to make by releasing this conversation?",Can IOTA be forked?

I do not condone the behavior of CFB. If nothing else these logs reveal he is decidedly and completely unfit for any leadership position. He simply does not have interpersonal relation skills that would allow him to carry out any vision, no matter how genius.    That being said CFB made them public. Whether we like that or not they are out for the world to see. This should be something that I find out about in the main IOTA sub, not something that I stumble upon randomly.

2059,1,"With the recent news of QUBIC being abandoned and the future direction of IOTA regarding smart contracts being drastically changed, there has been lot of speculation (fear?) spreading among the community. David S√∏nsteb√∏ went ahead and proposed a good old 'Question &amp; Answer' session (And we should thank him for that). I was going through it once again so I made a summary (sorted by upvotes) for those interested :  **What's the difference between Qubic/IOTA Smart Contracts?**  Qubic was a completely new computational model \[‚Ä¶\] The future direction of IOTA Smart Contracts is a lot more ""traditional""  **Is it just a renaming of Qubic?**  No.  **What happened to the original Qubic vision with outsourced computations and such?**  Outsourced computations, Oracles and Conditional Transactions/Smart Contracts are still on the roadmap. The biggest difference is essentially a clearer path in both development and subsequent adoption.  **Do you start over from scratch again for smartcontracts v2? Do we really need to wait again 1-2 years for something tangible which we can try out?**  The Smart Contract pivot started a few months ago and will absolutely not take anywhere near the same time as Qubic \[‚Ä¶\] Contract abilities to the IOTA project in the near term, rather than being dependent on breakthroughs that need to be vetted and accepted over years.  **What are IF's plans regarding Qubic? (i.e.dedicated hardware, Abra/Qupla languages, tools around that, etc).**  IOTA Foundation has no plans to continue developing Qubic.  **Is IF going to actively continue designing on this?**  It will start with the PoC and blog post on Monday. Everything IF has built of Qubic will be opened for curious CS enthusiasts. If it happens that someone picks up on the work we have done and deliver, we will certainly look into collaborating, but at the moment it's not a priority.  **What are your core partners needing from Iota and are you on time to deliver for when they need it ?**  \[‚Ä¶\] the answer is quite simple: the numero uno priority is Tangle performance so they can exit pilot/PoC stage and implement it into their products while knowing that the Tangle will perform as the theory says. Same goes for smart contracts. \[‚Ä¶\] For the next 2-3 years, basic smart contract functionality is more than sufficient \[‚Ä¶\] We want to build solutions to problems that there is a demand for.  **Is it possible in the future to create new tokens on IOTA (i.e. ERC-20 tokens) with the same characteristics as IOTA (Feeless and scalable)?**  Colored coins will be possible on IOTA indeed, exactly how this ties in with Coordicide and the token economics is yet to be fleshed out though.  **Can you rephrase your statement on Qubic? Many people are saying Qubic is dead but are there any elements of Qubic that can be brought forward to SC?**  \[‚Ä¶\] original Qubic never really manifested since rather than CFB leading the effort \[‚Ä¶\] Qubic isn't completely dead in the sense that it fell apart as unpromising or failed. IOTA Foundation is simply not going to pour more resources into it due to resource restraints and more promising near-term approaches. \[‚Ä¶\] The goal here is to bring functional Smart Contracts to IOTA **ASAP \[‚Ä¶\]** Does this mean the novel ideas from Qubic is forever abandoned and will never find their way into the IOTA ecosystem? No, but we have to prioritize.  **Are smart contract's and/or Qubic delivery linked to coordicide?**  No, Qubic and Coordicide are independent. Coordicide is not at all affected by the pivot away from pouring resources into Qubic.  **Will there be a separate section for smart contracts in Roadmap website, as in Smart contract MVP section?**  The Roadmap will indeed be updated to reflect this.  **Will resources be pulled from Qubic and be placed in some other assignment?**  Yes, all resources that have been used on Qubic is now being allocated to other projects within IF.  **Can iota smart contracts also sufficiently address those problems \[THOSE THAT QUBIC WAS TRYING TO SOLVE\]?**  Of course.  **Is iota‚Äôs focus still to make contributions to the machine learning/AI industry but only through the data validation and value transfer aspects rather than distributed computation?**  Definitely, though it's not on the top of our list \*right now\*. \[‚Ä¶\] Safe AGI for me is still one of my chief goals in life.  **Is that too much to ask \[TO KEEP THE ROADMAP UP TO DATE\]?**  Not at all. Unfortunately, right after the MoonPay hack, there was a bug in the Roadmap that needed frontend resources to fix. \[‚Ä¶\] Our goal is for the roadmap to allow people to stay on top of the IOTA project's developments in ""real-time"".  **How is it possible that those in charge of the project never contested Qubic and its real-life feasibility to an extent, at which this would have manifested in a complete revision/overhaul of the concept in 2 years' time?**  There is no denying that we were very enthusiastic about Qubic \[‚Ä¶\] At the time the ambitious goal of developing and delivering an innovative novel hardware solution for IoT, which Qubic would work in harmony with on the software layer. So indeed at the time the idea of specialized IOTA hardware and software that would be implemented across the whole IoT sector was indeed a big deal.  **What has the IOTA Foundation learned from this episode, and how will it go forward in regards to communication and project management?**  Everyone that has worked on Qubic has done a tremendous job being able to take abstract ideas and distilling it into something concrete. However, just like the Tangle was experimental early on, as was Qubic. \[‚Ä¶\] Welcome to the world of invention and experimentation, not everything works out. I will never apologize for this, I'm a man who only cares about science and progress, \[‚Ä¶\] I also don't see adapting as a failure, it's a learning lesson.  **What structural changes will the Foundation promote to make sure the community will be included early on in development in a more holistic manner to avoid fallouts like this?**  In terms of lessons for the IOTA Foundation overall, we have naturally learned a lot as a continuously growing entity that is less than 2.5 years old.  \[‚Ä¶\] We are all very happy with the direction that both the IOTA project and the IOTA Foundation is now headed.  **Did the corona situation change anything considering the roadmap or is ETA for Coordicide still 2021?**  **\[‚Ä¶\]** CFB drama, MoonPay/Trinity-hack and coronavirus all naturally impacted the IOTA project \[‚Ä¶\] we are still very confident in the delivery of Coordicide in 2021. Nothing has fundamentally changed \[‚Ä¶\]  **Will IOTA 1.5 be delivered as you guys said by august 2020 and do you still think that coordicide will Happen in Q1 2021?**  Yes.  **Remember when the community got suspicious that Jinn and Qubic were never going to happen? You called us lazy moonboys. Why should we trust you now? Why should you still be at the helm of Iota when nothing in the original vision had culminated into anything meaningful?**  The original vision of IOTA is still the driving force of IOTA. Nothing has changed in terms of the vision. \[‚Ä¶\] I certainly lashed out at lazy moonbois making accusations that Jinn and Qubic was vaporware, because it never was.  **Vapourware definition from Wiki: ‚Äòvaporware is a product, typically computer hardware or software, that is announced to the general public but is never actually manufactured nor officially cancelled‚Äô. Looks like Jinn and Q were vapourware after all...**  Well Jinn was officially canceled and Qubic is being opened and explained, so I still reject the vaporware connotations.  **Why should the community trust IOTA Smart Contracts is/will ever be produced based on your history with Jinn and now QQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQQ?**  I am not asking anyone to trust us. I know what we are doing, as do our team, as do the community members contributing and thus following development closely. I have no problem with anyone doubting me/IF and simply surprising with delivery.  **Why are you still refusing to come out crystal clear about the JINN fiasco? What has been done, if anything etc.?**  It's a matter of priority. Jinn was never a scam. \[‚Ä¶\] and we have built interesting technology with it, but with me being caught up in IOTA 24/7 and CFB choosing to quit to focus on Paracosm, the management of Jinn suffered greatly.  **How tall are you?**  \['SURPRISINGLY', DAVID DIDN'T ANSWER. BUT OTHERS DID\]  Not sure why all the downvotes. Seems like a valid concern.  \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Following this session, other clarifications were announced by :  \-IOTA developers regarding the current IOTA progress :  [IOTA progress as posted by one of their DEV](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/fyzdjf/iota_progress_as_posted_by_one_of_their_dev/)  \- Samuel Reid, former Qubic Architect regarding QUBIC :  [\[Qubic\] Unreleased Quorum Based Computations Paper](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/fzl6yw/qubic_unreleased_quorum_based_computations_paper/)  \-Charlie Varley (Trinity Lead Developer) regarding IOTA and smart contracts : [An introduction to IOTA Smart Contracts: Qubic's Replacement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/fzv1hm/an_introduction_to_iota_smart_contracts_qubics/)",Summary of Q&amp;A (with David S√∏nsteb√∏) and recent announcements

2062,1,"**Here is a quick summary of what is planned for IOTA Smart Contracts, previously a subset of Qubic and now a flagship project, by lead dev Evaldas DrƒÖsutis.**  ""Some people wonder about the relation between Qubic and IOTA Smart Contracts. Here's my comment on that matter.  In short:  IOTA Smart Contracts were derived from the Qubic project and retain many of its useful features. It can be seen as a spin-off, switching priorities to a more pragmatic direction. Essentially, IOTA Smart Contracts are ""quorum based computations"" and therefore do not deviate too far from the ""classical"" Qubic. However, as requested by many members of the community and by our industrial partners, it is completely agnostic of hardware and computation model.  The longer story:  I was working on Qubic, mostly on Qupla/Abra, even before joining IF. I continued my work in IF, but this time I concentrated on what is called ""Quorum Based Computations"" or QBC in short.I see QBC as a main part of the longstanding vision, of bringing trustless computations to IOTA - that is how I read it. It is not that important what kind of processor performs those computations: binary, ternary, CPU or data flow. What IS important, is how a group of independent processors run distributed consensus via quorum voting.  My goal was to specify and implement a concrete architecture which would make all those qubics, assemblies, oracles, Q-nodes and oracle machines work together - the Qubic computation model and Abra were out of scope of this work.  After at least 4 versions of that specification, we ended up with what we call now IOTA Smart Contracts. I had to abandon many concepts I found in the original Qubic vision - on-tangle messaging, on-tangle consensus and Q-tangle - because this was too slow and prone to all kind of attacks. The Qubic assemblies transformed into permissioned committees of approver nodes, and suddenly there was no need neither for Sybil protection via resource tests, nor sophisticated commit-reveal protocols. We also solved the limitations of qubics being unable to move funds, by using threshold signatures and a UTXO transaction model.  The result is a fixed size committee of nodes (using distributed private key sharing) running a program under consensus and submitting results to the Tangle. Essentially we now have the Level 2 smart contracts, that are well known in the crypto space. If it swims like a duck etc, it is a duck.This Layer 2 design of IOTA Smart Contracts is an important legacy from the Qubic vision, which satisfies the requirements of scalability and low transaction costs.  Oracles and outsourced computations are possible using this approach, but are viewed as classes of use cases, rather than features of the core tech.  In the coming months we will be able to communicate more technical details and deliver an early (but working) version of the IOTA Smart Contract protocol on the GoShimmer platform. Then we invite active involvement of the community in all matters.""",An introduction to IOTA Smart Contracts: Qubic's Replacement

2065,1,"I personally view the switches from the IF away from trinary, qubic, jinn and quantum resistant signatures as very promising. They realized that those 4 goals were too ambitious at this point in time and have decided to focus their efforts on shorter term goals that will lead to quicker adoption. Many people in this space would prefer the foundation to stick with previous goals for the sake of remaining consistent, but this is not logical. The IF should always move in the direction of what's best for the industry and not what makes the project look unchanging. If science was unchanging we would still believe the earth is flat. The IF was not on track for adoption dumping resources into these projects, but due to the recent pivot they are now on track for major adoption. I'm very proud of the foundation's willingness to embrace change for the sake of industry adoption. Also keep in mind that qubic, trinary, jinn and quantum computing will be a part of our future, just not in the short term. In the meantime, contribute something meaningful to the project if you're able. If not, just wait for the future to unfold",My takeaway from the recent iota events

2073,1,"I wanted to write a post on some of the moving parts within the IOTA ecosystem so you have a better idea of what we are currently focussing on.  Right now IOTA is very much in a building stage. We have laid out our plans for Chrysalis and Coordicide. The development of each is chugging along. These are not simple or quick tasks. They require rigorous research, specification, engineering and testing.  Chrysalis  Chrysalis is IOTA 1.5. This is a much improved network, with much higher transactions per second and significantly faster confirmation times, as well as nice features like reusable addresses. Chrysalis is currently being implemented in the Hornet node software.  Hornet, a part-IF part-community effort, is a lightweight node written in Go. Hornet has been built to be more performant than our existing node software (IRI) and without all of the technical debt. A number of community members have just launched a new test network known as Comnet, comprised only of hornet nodes, on which I have seen 150 TPS with a conf. rate of 99%. It is looking very promising (and that is without the Chrysalis optimisations!)  Coordicide  Coordicide is IOTA 2.0: IOTA's solution to full decentralisation. It is currently being implemented and tested in GoShimmer. A GoShimmer testnet will demonstrate how Coordicide and its various components (including consensus, Mana etc.) work and provide an environment for developers to learn about the new possibilities Coordicide will enable (think coloured coins, dApps etc.).  The first Coordicide testnet with value transactions is a number of weeks away. We plan to provide a set of developer materials at launch to encourage experimentation.  Note that the development of Hornet and GoShimmer have been expedited by a shared library called Hive.go. The devs on both teams work closely together.  Bee  Meanwhile we also have Bee. Bee is our new Rust-based node software. It is being built for the longterm with specifications for both Chrysalis and Coordicide. Bee has been under development for a number of months and a prototype is planned for the near future. Bee will take the time it needs, but it will give us a robust node solution that will be around for years to come. The Bee devs are very active on Discord and I suggest you follow the various Bee channels to keep up-to-date.  Libraries: Client Libs, Streams, Digital Identity and Access  Then we have our libraries.  Client Libraries - With the upcoming changes for Chrysalis, we need an accompanying client library with which developers can build applications on IOTA. Our existing client libraries can be a little overwhelming to newcomers. The new library will be built to simplify the lives of developers, providing a one-stop-shop for core IOTA functions with much improved consistency, composability, abstraction and clarity. The specifications for a new core Rust library are currently being written.  Streams (formerly known as MAM) - We recently announced the release of the Streams alpha library written in Rust. This is our data transfer library that allows you to set up encrypted message channels on the Tangle. Streams is critical for many data-centric use cases and many of the more IOT-oriented use cases.  Identity - We recently announced our Unified Identity Protocol, with an initial implementation in TypeScript that will later be ported to Rust. The Unified Identity Protocol implements the W3C (near) standards on Digital Identity and Verifiable Credentials. This is an exciting project that will enable a lot of human and IOT-centric use cases. It is part of the Tangle EE working group (see below for further details).  Access - Access is another core library currently in the works. Further details about Access will be released soon.  Tangle EE: Identity and Data Marketplaces  Tangle EE is a working group under the Eclipse Foundation involving a wide selection of our core partners. Tangle EE is about adoption. It is a meeting place for the IOTA Foundation and its partners to work together and push forwards industry integration of IOTA. The two current streams within Tangle EE are Digital Identity and Decentralized Marketplaces. The data marketplace vision is very much alive within the Decentralized Marketplaces initiative.  Tangle EE is an essential component in IOTA's journey. It provides the necessary governance framework to involve commercial parties beyond the IOTA Foundation in key development and decision-making. The reason Identity and Decentralized Marketplaces fall under Tangle EE is because they represent two of our most important use case streams. Naturally, it makes sense for our partners that will adopt IOTA in those use case areas to work closely with us on their development.  A comment on partnerships  We have some exceptional partners (JLR, STMicroelectronics, Dell etc.) who are deeply involved in IOTA, actively building on the protocol, and identifying exactly how they will leverage the benefits of a production-ready Tangle. Chrysalis will be a very important step here.  Sum up  I have not managed to cover everything in this post, not even my own project Trinity (and our plans for a new, bulletproof wallet), but this should give a good idea of some of the important components within the IOTA ecosystem.  What should be clear is that the IOTA Foundation's engineering department is right now focussed very much on IOTA's core - node software, libraries, and the changes that come with Chrysalis and Coordicide. We are getting our house in order for a longterm future. And with all of these moving parts now in motion, we are on a solid path to success.  I understand that it is easy to see all of the changes and be concerned that the project is not on track or that the direction has changed. But substantial changes in technical direction (e.g. moving our focus to Binary, introducing the ed25519 and thereby reusable addresses, shifting Qubic's nearer-term focus to a more conventional form of smart contracts) should be welcomed if they bring clear benefits. IOTA's core vision remains completely in tact.  Hopefully this post gives everyone some clarity on the various pieces of the IOTA puzzle. A hell of a lot is going on behind the scenes and it can be hard to piece it all together.",IOTA progress as posted by one of their DEV
2074,1,,"Suddenly negative flood, Is it a planned strategy by competitors against IOTA?"
2075,1,"Well bois... I found out the news about qubic just now.   It's confirmed a feeling that has been growing on me over these last couple of months. Iota talks alot, but they don't get their work done. What have they been doing these last couple of years? They supposedly have around 100 developers, what do they do all day? Sit around and play games?   All we have seen is lots of fancy whitepapers. They managed to roll out the trinity recovery app quickly enough, but so far, what do they have to show for their thousands of hours of dev time? A fancy new qubic program? Wait what was that I hear? Canceled? Ok. How about something out of their partnerships? Something about an e-kroner? Oh wait, the competitor is rolling that out.   What is this about a new direction? Something about smart contracts? Buddy, no. I also have ethereum in my portfolio, and iota is 4 years to late to the party in the smart contract world.   I bought when Iota was $5. I bought when Iota was $3. I bought when Iota was $1. Today... after I heard the news about qubic I sold.   Sorry guys. I have about $20,000 worth of capital gains losses from this whole adventure, but iota lost the race vs ethereum. I had my hat on both horses. Ethereum and iota. Iota already had the scaling in play, and qubic was supposed to be their version of smart contracts.   Ethereum already had smart contracts, and their beacon chain+ shards was supposed to be their scaling. The first crypto to get both unlimited scaling + computation was the winner in my books. Well... not only did iota just throw in the towel on qubic, but they decided to go off on this smart contracts route. No offense, that is what ethereum does. That is what eos does. That is what tron does.   There is nothing different now between eos and iota except eos is a lot farther along in their development cycle. And ethereum is getting ready to release ethereum 2.0 this summer. And they will have staking, which means people get rewarded for holding eth. Not only that but with their new fee schedule, it looks like they might even go into negative inflation, which is a double reason to hold eth. Not to mention that, but while the iota foundation has a hundred devs or so, I see the majority of new projects using ethereum as their backbone.   Guys, I hate to say this, but I am selling. I am out. I wish you all the best, but if Iota is going to abandon quibic, they no longer have an ace up their sleeve. Bye. And no you can't have my iotas, I sold them for eth. 20 giota worth. cheers.",The end of an era

2078,1,I think this is the third time the IF build a fancy new website and promised to keep it updated. Most entry‚Äôs are out of date and the recent name change of the modules is not incorporated (everywhere) yet. Some goals are still set to end in February without an update.  I really like the progress IF is making. But failing yet again to keep their (third) attempt on a roadmap updated is not very reassuring. Based on this I can only imagine how outdated their dev documentation must be like üòï,https://roadmap.iota.org/
2079,1,"I have been silently following this project since its beginning. Back in 2017, following points have made IOTA exceptional and stand out from other crypto projects:   - Data Marketplace  - Special, trinary hardware: Jinn  - Qubic  -Over a hundred of partnerships, with many huge companies like BOSCH, Telecom, Fujitsu, VW  etc.   Now we have (almost) mid 2020.  - Data Marketplace was declared ""off focus"" and made open source for others to finish. Right now it is totally abandoned wasteland.  - The idea of trinary hardware was thrown away. Jinn is finally declared dead.  - Quibic is now also ""off focus"" and for others to finish....  - Not a single partnership have given any results. I dont expect a finished product, but at least a small feedback about the current status from at least some of companies would be nice. Instead we got total silence, which for me means, that all those partnership announcements are dead now too.  - Cooordicide is still miles away and will probably not be finished this or even the next year.   Is IF really know what it is doing? How IOTA project is now any different from, lets say DOGE coin since all of its unique applications have been abandoned?",What is left from the IOTA project we were introduced to back in 2017?

2083,1,"I'm a developer new to IOTA. I'd like to know if IOTA has a concept of a ""tainted coin""?   In other words: Is there a way to have a coin, or a piece of data, living in the Tangle, that has its own identity and can be transfered?  The best example, I guess, would be some kind of digital weapons in a video game. Could I use IOTA to represent a specific instance of a weapon I would create, and then be able to sell it? Could the buyer then prove he is the owner of the weapon he bought? Could he later sell this weapon to someone else and have the ownership transfered to the new buyer in a way that this ownership would be trackable in the Tangle?","Does IOTA have ""tainted coins""?"

The funding, I know that Dominik addressed this in HelloIOTA Roundup 031 -   ""Apart from being very prudent about our spending, we have also been actively looking at different financing options. The good part about the current situation is that it opened up new avenues for us to acquire financing without having to touch our token treasury for the forseeable future.""  ""As a final comment, throughout the history of IOTA we have shown our resiliency and preservance even under the most extreme conditions. This current situation right now, while it poses certain risks, will not impact the success of IOTA.""  I find it hard keeping any stake in the project while the funding situation has not been resolved and publicly communicated, I myself worked for a company that faired through a lot of storms, when the most recent downturn came it firmly believed it will obtain the much needed funding, acquire new clients and fair through the storm once again, it's didn't.  2. I think IOTA does an amazing job at communicating what has been done through a series of visually appealing posts via their blog, YouTube channel and other channels.  3. The hate/ridicule from /r/cryptocurrency, I know that it does not represent the whole crypto sphere, but it is alarming because new people often go there to be a part of the community and do their research.

I thought of that today as I was listening to Charles Hoskinson talking about how Wikipedia moderators simply delete crypto-related articles. Not because guidelines were not followed, but because the moderators there generally consider crypto to be scam. In addition, this is handled differently in different countries.

2576,1,,IOTA Trinity wallet hack - status update
2578,1,"A short update about the current situation.  1. As a reminder, ALL TRINITY USERS WHO OPENED TRINITY BETWEEN 17 DECEMBER 2019 AND 18 FEBRUARY 2020 WILL NEED TO USE THE SEED MIGRATION TOOL IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR TOKENS. We are still working on building and testing the seed migration tool. We will inform you here as soon as it is ready.  2. Last night we released an updated mobile wallet for both iOS and Android. Please visit the App Store or Play Store respectively to download it or update your current version. While, as of now, we have no indication that mobile users were affected by the attack, out of an abundance of caution, WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT EVEN MOBILE WALLET USERS CHANGE THEIR PASSWORD AND USE THE SEED MIGRATION TOOL AS SOON AS IT‚ÄôS AVAILABLE.  3. Trinity users who have already updated their wallets will have noticed the removal of MoonPay services from the updated versions of the wallet. This was necessary because the security vulnerability was introduced into the Trinity wallet via the MoonPay integration. We are working on an incident report in which we will publicly disclose the details of the vulnerability, how it was introduced, how it was exploited, and the steps we are taking to improve our security practices as a whole.  4. We have received requests from several users to provide information as to whether any Trinity users‚Äô credit card information might have been compromised in connection with this security incident. Moonpay provides payment processing as a function of its own platform, which is independent of Trinity. For now, we can only share with the community the below statement from Moonpay on this matter. Please note that the IOTA Foundation is not in a position to independently verify the accuracy of the statement, due to the fact that the evidence to support it is not in our possession.  MoonPay Statement to Customers on Credit Card Information  ‚ÄúMoonPay, as a partner of Trinity Wallet, has been working with the IOTA Foundation and third-party experts to assist with the ongoing investigation. At this time, as the payment processor of the Trinity Wallet, we want to inform users who have input their credit card details into the Trinity Wallet that, to the best of our knowledge, their credit card information is unlikely to have been compromised by this security incident. Credit card details are encrypted and processed in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. However, until the investigation has been completed, we would like to ask users who purchased Miota using the Trinity Wallet to monitor their statements and report any suspicious activity they observe to their banks immediately.‚Äù  5.We are constantly in contact with law enforcement in several countries and are working closely with them to ensure fast and thorough investigations. If you‚Äôre an affected user, we would greatly appreciate it if you could please file a report with your local police, as this will help us with the criminal investigations. In most countries you can quickly file a report online. We recommend that you include in your report the following German case file number so that the authorities in your country can quickly get in touch with the other authorities already working on the investigation elsewhere:  Germany, Center for Cybercrime, Case Number: 200213-1717-i00290  6. We are still refining the remediation plan in light of continuously updated information and will provide further details as soon as we can.  Thank you all for your patience. We will continue to update you on all important developments as we are able.",Moonpay integration had security vulnerability - Update status.iota.org

2581,1,"After being very active for the better part of two years, around half a year ago I stopped participating in discussions.   Before that, I truly enjoyed wasting a bit of time by envisioning a better, fairer, more productive and self-determined future.   But whenever talking to someone or reading discussions with people interested in crypto from outside of the IOTA multiverse, I kept noticing a defining argumentative discrepancy between IOTA enthusiasts and IOTA opponents:   In nearly all discussions in which opinions clash(ed), IOTA enthusiasts are usually well aware of the current semi-centralised nature of IOTA, but have a coordinator-free future in mind - and in their arguments.   Most people opposing IOTA, on the other hand, usually base their critique solely on today‚Äôs characteristics of the protocol and its current performance.   Discussions are basically dumbed down resulting into two extreme ends in the spectrum of viewpoints: IOTA supporters believe and discuss the future, which arguably for the most part only exists on paper and hasn‚Äôt materialized yet, while IOTA opponents ignore the inevitable: that there will be *some* form of future.   While it‚Äôs not a certainty that IOTA‚Äôs future will pan out exactly (or even as succesful) as envisioned, it‚Äôs also extremely unlikely that it will be frozen in time in the status quo.  Arguing that it *will be* fully decentralized is wrong in my opinion. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the underlying math sure does indicate the potential and I wouldn‚Äôt be engaged if I wouldn‚Äôt see any potential, but the future outcome simply isn‚Äôt a certainty (yet).   Arguing that IOTA is e.g. not decentralized *today* of course is also mind boggling, as everyone is well aware of it‚Äôs status quo while any potential for a different outcome in the future and rather likely changes are categorically denied and ignored by this argumentation.   Point being: Why argue with someone who is fixated on the status quo and thus categorically denies that ongoing development will most likely result in change? Sure, no one knows *what* change. But *no* change at all?  And if *any* change is likely, why do we keep discussing the status quo with critics?  *Centralised garbage!‚Äú, ‚ÄûThey can turn it off at will‚Äú, ‚ÄûDumpster fire! No value transfers for a week‚Äú* and all those other one-line arguments dearly collected and often repeated by critics are solely based in the status quo.   Critical, sound arguments not based on the status quo do actually exist, but they are extremely rare.  If in doubt, maybe revisit a few articles and blog posts of IOTA‚Äôs partners and businesses exploring IOTA and check whether any of them praises the *current* state of the protocol. I am of the opinion they don‚Äôt. They are all talking about the potential of it, extrapolating their options and benefits of the coming future.   The network isn‚Äôt production ready yet, everyone including ALL partners, external businesses and developers are aware of the current capabilities of the network while hardly anyone *currently* uses it productively or relies their business on functioning value transfers.   One could therefore argue that **the status quo simply isn‚Äôt the reason why any businesses or any individuals are interested in IOTA**  In my opinion it‚Äôs therefore questionable whether discussions about the network in its current state, as of *today*, have any merit at all. I am even pretty certain that it truly doesn‚Äôt matter whether value transfers are currently possible.   While we would all love it to be the case, let‚Äôs be realistic: Business wise, no one built for *today*. Everyone does so for *tomorrow*. *Today* simply doesn‚Äôt offer the advantages anyone would seek in DLT. But that doesn‚Äôt stop anyone from exploring their options already today, getting ready for the future.   If the status quo henceforth doesn‚Äôt really matter, I would suggest not to waste too much time with critics fixated on the current state of the protocol, or at least to point out that their sole interest seems to be the IOTA they already know, but not the one everyone except them is interested in.  There are two parties required for a conversation. But there‚Äôs no need to argue on topics that have been set by the opposing party.  If you feel the need, do pick your fights. But I would suggest not to follow every dangling carrot around.   ... or simply let the other party know that you would rather like to talk about Apples instead of those old carrots.   ‚Äî-  *^Note:** I am not affiliated with the IOTA Foundation. The above is my personal opinion.",A matter of perspective

This ‚Äúhacking‚Äù problem is a good opportunity to expose that there is a CLEAR problem with FREEDOM SPEECH in other subreddits (specially on /cryptocurrency).  We are being targeted by some absolutist anti-IOTA mods that are using the relativity of human language/communication to acuse us of shilling, trying to manipulate, create an utopia view on IOTA just because we publish legit news (when they are good), comment factually on threads responding to anti-IOTA people that might just be misinformed, or any type of siding with IOTA project.  As I said, this recent problem with IOTA is a great opportunity of proving this (even tho we don‚Äôt need proof, it‚Äôs obvious by the quantity of bans, deleted threads and FUD on their subreddit) because as we can see, negative news/reviews are clearly open in their subreddit and I‚Äôm not opposed.

2691,1,"Hello Iota developers, users, and fans.  I wanted to reach out to the community and discuss the benefits of paid, professional security review of open source software. Open source and particularly the cryptocurrency world are rapidly expanding, and some projects directly underpin billions of dollars in infrastructure while relying on altruistic security review for most of the components of their software.  Some projects, like Iota, take extra security steps and get independent security review of various components, but it is important to understand that security is not an on/off switch. It is an ongoing process and requires constant vigilance. You cannot commission a security audit, get an all clear, and then permanently rely on that project to be bug free. You need periodic peer review as well as focused review on major updates. You need to mix up who is doing the review to get varied expertise. You need to use the ""everything and the kitchen sink"" approach.  Security is extremely difficult. Combine that challenge with trying to do multiple novel things at the same time, and the difficulty of keeping it all working exactly as intended increases exponentially.  There's a lot of basic security hygiene that can be practiced that can improve software development and reduce the chance of catastrophic bugs, but things like automated scanning and fuzzing can only go so far, especially if you are doing something new.  Additionally, security review is not all encompassing. After all, the reviewers are humans and everyone has skill gaps and bad days. It is crucial to manage who is on the team doing the review, and how much time they spend on a particular project to avoid burnout. It is also important to use different security teams as the review process moves forward and the software matures, to get different perspectives.  IOTA is one of the few cryptocurrency projects that is trying to do new things and move the cryptocurrency space toward something novel. I hope that this recent incident and community pressure can increase the focus on security review of both the theoretical papers and the implementation of those ideas into code. We are a nonprofit that works in exactly this space and can help, but I'm not here for the hard sell. I just hope that the devs and community want to move toward a proactive approach instead of a reactive one. The Foundation needs to build a network of highly skilled researchers to review their core components and dependencies and to keep a close eye on them as the project evolves.  Keep working toward making something important, IOTA. You're doing good work.  \-DZ",The Importance of Independent Security Review

2758,1,"As a SoC (system on chip) and embedded software engineer the idea of ternay was one of the only things I disliked about IOTA. I‚Äôm really relieved that they got rid of it. Why? Because all tools and the whole semiconductor industry is focused, tailored towards and optimized for binary. This would require a change that just cannot happen - even not within one decade. What do you think the reason is that JINN didn‚Äôt have a proof-of-concept ternary processor? Why Isn‚Äôt anyone in INTEL, STM, ARM, AMD , etc. working on ternary?   Power consumption is important but rest assured - you can already make ultra low-powered or even self-powered IOT devices today that consume currents in the microampere range.  Switching to binary will speed things up. And tbh in future I don‚Äôt even want IOTA to use ternary unless they come up with a fully-fleteched paper describing the theory and the proven advantages of ternary over binary.  IMO ternary was a dream of CfB that might sound good at the beginning but terrible if you take the idea a few realistic steps forward.",Binary over Ternary - the right step

2780,1,"So DS has elected to make the change to binary to accommodate corporate interests in the near future.  CfB is understandably irritated because the goal was to be revolutionary with ternary in the first place.  The change doesn‚Äôt rule out the ability to be ternary down the road, but the change allows for faster adoption now.  CfB‚Äôs paracosm was predicated on ternary and the use of swarm ternary processors. At any rate, it slows down his momentum.  I for one want the goal of ternary to become a reality sooner than later. But I understand the shift to be more corporate friendly in the short run.  CfB has a right to be upset about it. This was his brainchild and it‚Äôs being set on a cross country road trip instead of being focused on the quarter mile.  All in all, iota as an architecture is still on path to be as dominant as was hyped up. But we are just gonna have to wait a little longer until it takes over the world.

2791,1,I bought IOTA at more than 3 dollars years ago and now the price is around 30 Cents. Is this all hype even now? I put in my life savings in.   Ultimately it is the finance behind the idea that matters. IOTA was around 9th place when I bought. Today it is in 18th place. Why is no one pushing IOTA to get the market fundamentals right so that there will be a good valuation instead of still doing the hype. What is going on?  I mean why are 17 companies ahead of IOTA. Why is not IOTA not in 2nd place?   I am getting tired of the nonsense about all this technical stuff. No one cares about technical stuff if it does not have market adoption. VHS beat out Sony though Sony had a better product. Ultimately it is how well the product is accepted by the market that matters and how much the valuation improved that matters. Much better products lost in the world and I hope IOTA is different. But it does not look different.   What is being done so that IOTA will regain its position and have better financial picture for the coin.,Is IOTA Ever Getting Market Adoption?

2922,1,"Like so many of you out there, I am very optimistic about Iota‚Äôs future impact.  Furthermore, like so many of the Iota supporters active on this subreddit, I too am very hopeful that we will eventually see an overlap between the Tangle infrastructure and an Elon Musk endeavor.  Being fast, secure and feeless are all fundamental to enable a highly robust and efficient autonomous network to operate continuously on a truly global scale. So far in my research on distributed ledgers, Iota is one of, if not the most, qualified and capable suitor to provide infrastructure to future autonomous networks.   The autonomous Tesla fleet is an obvious one that comes to mind; in which Iota could potentially provide the neural network that facilitates communication between all the autonomous vehicles, and the OTA software updates they will so frequently release.  However, I have a hunch that the biggest impact to potentially be realized is in the form of two up-and-coming transcendent endeavors that are currently being built by Elon Musk. These include Neuralink and Starlink.  Surely we all heard of Neuralink by now: A fully functioning brain-to-machine interface condensed into a 4x4mm chip that reads and writes to and from the brain, through electromagnetic record keeping of neurons via microscopic electrodes imbedded in the brain.  It sure is a mouthful, and it can be hard to believe is actually a possibility in our lifetime, let alone as soon as 2021. The invention of this soon-to-be commercial interface will not be possible unless its communication to the greater overall network is facilitated by a highly-secure and seamless network. Iota‚Äôs tangle may very well be the only architecture capable of facilitating such a demanding infrastructure. And it is for this reason that I am so hopeful and optimistic about a potential Neuralin  synergy.  Finally, one of Elon‚Äôs more recent projects being brought  to light is Star link; Elon Musks ambitious plan to release tens of thousands of satellites in complex yet patterned formation in low-earth Orbit.  It will not only be a crucial piece in providing an ever-shifting beacon to the vast fleet of space crafts, but also the theoretically lowest latency bandwidth of internet offered to humans everywhere across the globe.  Like Neuralink, Starlink will essentially provide thousands upon thousands of cutting edge antennas for humans and machines to constantly interact with. These antennas will orbit in a very specific pattern around the earth to ensure anyone, anywhere have fast, safe, and cheap modes of connecting to the. And just like noted before, Iota may just be the only ledger architecture capable of maintaining this ambitious endeavor.  Starlink might end up being the most opted-for medium of accessing the internet humanity has ever seen if all goes as planned.  So when comparing to Neuralink and a Tesla autonomous fleet, Starlink may be entirely more reliant on the need for a secure network architecture.  It‚Äôs magnitude may carry farther in scale when considering the ever-morphing linkage and decoupling of orbiting satellites.  Simply put, Neuralink and Tesla could pale in comparison to the absolute grand scale and reach Starlink is projecting to have.  All of these endeavors put forth by Elon seem like perfect proof of concepts that Iota‚Äôs tangle could thrive in facilitating. It just feels as though Elon Musk and Iota are destined to exist in the same sentence when you consider all factors and what he wants to create.  Although, until we see the breaking headlines of an association between the two entities, I‚Äôll will continue to salivate over the possibilities.",Starlink + Iota ‚Äî Neuralink + Iota

3042,1,"Ok, maybe this has been explained before, but I still don‚Äôt understand the concept of permanodes to this level of detail: Say I own a business and I want to store my measuring values immutably on the tangle. That‚Äôs why I run my own full node. If I want to access my measuring values forever, I have to make it a permanode. But does that mean I have to store the all transactions of the tangle? I mean, my node confirms my and other transactions that are then immutable in the tangle, but my permanode will become very large (at &gt;1000 tps, it will grow quite rapidly...). Is there a way to have kind of a ‚Äúselective permanode‚Äù?  Second part of my question: If I use e.g IoT device like ESP32 or STM32 for data acquisition and transfer to my gateway (which is the IOTA full node at the same time), how can I guaranty the values arrived untampered in the tangle? Do I have to use STM32, since it already is able to store values on the tangle and doesn‚Äôt have to transfer to the gateway? I understand it acts as a light node. How to achieve that with a ESP32 (or other) device?  Thanks for any hints.","First, how big will a permanode become and if I run one myself, can I store only transactions that are important to me? Second, how to get real un-tamparable connection with measuring devices and node?"

3124,1,"I was just sitting here thinking about Iota and the new roadmap, so I thought I would share.  Like a lot of you, I've followed Iota for a couple of years, summer of 2017 (what a great time that was, huh!) In the early Iota days, timelines were delayed, the community got overly hyped over the slightest hint at progress, and there seemed to be a never ending stream of negative news. I've seen young organizations endure this before, but not quite to the extent of the IF. I'm guessing it's because the idea of really pushing the technical envelope didn't sit well with many people in the cryptosphere. In fact, a lot of these same people still yell ""Iota is a scam!""  Meanwhile the IF has grown into a decent size organization, and the community has grown even more. David used to rip people online constantly, and still will on occasion, but I sense that he has matured a bit as a leader and has learned to let people do their thing and just keep plugging away.  I've always thought Dom was mature beyond his years, but he has really come into his own as a speaker and what I consider ""Lead Evangelist"" for Iota. Again, remarkable growth and maturity.  Then you add in people like Dan, Hans, Eric and the rest of the team and it's really easy to see why this project will ultimately have a lot of success.   So what does this have to do with the roadmap? Past failures. Ok, not really failures, but opportunities to grow.   I'm fairly certain that previous dates and communications have taught this team a ton about PR and how easily things can be misinterpreted. The new roadmap removes a lot of uncertainty without being overly complex. The timelines are vague enough to be flexible and account for setbacks, but at the same time solid enough to provide visibility into the direction the teams are headed. For anyone involved in Enterprise level software dev, you know this is how it's done. This gives me personally a lot of confidence that the IF will be able to meet their goals.   The IF, particularly the early guys, walked through the fire and came out better on the other side. As an investor I will bet on those kind of people any day. In the end that grit and determination will win. And the fact that all of this has been done in one of the worst bear markets in history is even more phenomenal.   In my opinion, the new roadmap is more than just some guideposts. It reflects an evolution of a team that is more than capable of winning.  I know some IF members will read this, so thank you for what you are doing. The M2M economy has the potential to significantly improve the world and I am grateful to be able to watch you all help bring it to life.  TLDR for the short attention spans: The new roadmap highlights just how far the IF has come.  Also: This is all just my opinion based on my personal experience. You may have a different opinion and that's ok. I'm not interested in arguing with you.",Random roadmap thoughts

I don't want to explain much, so check out LoRa for yourself. What I'm interested in, is there any approach to IOTA with this technology?  Are the two technologies facing each other as competition or will they eventually merge or have an interface? I know that IOTA with Qubic and the tokens have completely different approaches, but it is also known as the ""Backbone of IOT"".  A possible interface would also be the STM32 board with LoRa modules. Has anyone played with it or experience?  How do you see the future with these two technologies?  I would appreciate a few thoughts  Thank you very much, lg","LoRaWan LoRa - competition, implementation or similar ??"

I think he only left to be more focused on his company grandcentrix (I could also be wrong I did not follow that part). A couple of weeks ago he posted that his company has been acquired by Vodafone.

Second option could lead back to IOTA someday  Maybe someone can answer me that question  Thanks guys,Relation between IF &amp; Ralf Rottmann (grandcentrix)

3369,1,"Hello,  As a person dealing with statistics in my daily life, I have seen many published paper have doubtful conclusion based on simply ""statistical significancy""(which is a p-value less than 0.05) in social science, psychology research, medical research and political science.  However, it is hard to further investigate as the published paper do not publish their data. As a researcher, you can inquire the author for the data but it is not an ideal process.  It is very beneficial to the whole world if there exists a research data marketplace where people can published their data which associated with their paper. Not only researcher in that field can do replication analysis and further digging into the details but also it boost the whole academic area for students to learn with the original data.  It is a perfect fit for DLT since the data needs to be immutable once published. If this is not the case, people don't have the trust source for research replication, and for any important paper, people won't publish their original data if the website can modify it.  It is another income source for independent researcher. If the paper worth of replication, students are willing to pay a small fee for the original data since they can learn faster and much better through this way and have much better literature review when they publish their paper. The exposure is probably in hundreds or thousands of the citation number.  It would be a much better place for academic area in general. Both students and researcher now have a data market in their field for search potential related area and perhaps can enhance the overall quality of data measurement for the whole research world.  There are so many benefits in this and it seems a perfect fit for IOTA as tx is feeless and can send data through the immutable ledger, and the best part is that there is no oracle needed as you can validate the data based on whether you can replicate the author's result.  Right now I see more endeavor of IOTA on data marketplace, I really hope people from IOTA foundation can realize how much potential there is for a research data marketplace. It is beneficial to the whole world.  There are many hurdles, for example right now the data in the data marketplace is streaming data but here it is static. The data also might be large but I think it is solvable maybe as bitorrent?  I have some thoughts on this and you can find me on discord as @Reigia",A proposal for Research Data Marketplace that I think is very important to the whole world

The protocol has some added features that enhances both privacy and unlink-ability (much more details in the whitepaper) of parties being in communication. So essentially it is an untraceable messaging platform that has no middle man or ownership of your messages.   I hope the community will like this project and see this as a useful tool.

I recently finished my current project (which has nothing to do with cryptocurrencies) and now I would like to do to something with Iota.  It's somewhat difficult to find a good idea though, so maybe you guys have ideas you would like to share :)  Here is what I'm looking for:  - It must be something people can use productively. I don't code for the sake of coding but to generate something of value. I don't mind distributing it for free though. Earning money is not the goal.  - It should be something new. While I do contribute to open source projects every now and then, it's more fun when you start from scratch.  - No hardware stuff. I simply can't distribute hardware to be used in conjunction with my software. It should be a web, mobile or desktop application which doesn't require specialized hardware.  - It shouldn't be possible without cryptocurrency like Iota. I'm no ""decentralize everything"" maximalist, sorry. If you could use PayPal, credit cards, ... as payment solution instead of Iota, then I don't see the point in using Iota.   Thank you =)",I'm a developer looking for an idea for a Iota based side project

3641,1,"I really like IOTA and the amazing implications, however there is one limitation I cannot reason away;  My issue with IOTA is that while it helps share ""the truth"" and maintains integrity though the means of cryptographic and consensus.   It still (and forever) has the issue of GIGO garbage in - garbage out.   I see marketing materials around IOTA solving the issue of tracking supply chain inventory, or verifying that sustainable standard are met.   But what if the devices are lying... the entry point to the IOTA world is though one of the client libraries, and what if a malicious programmer purposely inflates the sensor values?  With IOTA being seen as a ""truthful source"" this opens it up to dangerously automating trust? no?   In the case of tracking the origin of an asset, aren't the companies doing the reports incentivized to have their devices mis-report? (EG. my solar panel made 100MW, when it really only made 50).   Yes IOTA removes the ability to edit the data after tangle propagation, but kinda just incentivizes bad actors to just manipulate a earlier point in the process..  What technologies (hardware) do not allow for manipulations by the device holder? Is there a way to verify the data from a sensor directly (and not the program that sends it to IOTA)?

3670,1,"So as part of a seminar I had to study the architecture of IOTA. Me and my professor came to the conclusion that IOTA does not scale in the current implementation. Here is why:  \- In order to confirm transactions on the network, a node must know about all the other transactions on the network. Thus, every node must receive every transaction made in the network (from the current milestone).   \- The limiting factor is bandwidth and the processing power of the device (how fast it can update its database locally). Which is not that high, when taking into account that IOTA wants to be the backbone for IOT devices.   \-  This is like making Bitcoin scaleable by removing the blocksize limit. This is unwanted as it comes at the cost of decentralisation -&gt; only data centers are able to deal with such a workload -&gt; less machines are validating -&gt; less secure  Is there a solution that allows a node to register only a subset of the transaction but still contributing to the security of the network?   I know I will get downvoted for this post but rather than downvote me, educate me by telling me where I am wrong!

On a side note, this student finds crypto price volatility (in relation to fiat - none of this 1btc is 1btc bullshit) to be an issue that would be difficult to assume in any working system for his business or any other that is involved in IoT.

My main concern is that IOTA will not be a great investment, owing to its poor tokenomics model:   * No reason to hold besides as a medium of exchange  * No fees, instant transactions    * Great tech, but will ultimately lead to a very high velocity token * For reference, BTC's annual velocity is \~10 (\~$1.5T annual transfers, \~$150B market cap)    * For comparison, BCH (with lower fees) is \~50-100 * At scale, IOTA will most likely have a token velocity of *at least* 100 (am I wrong?) * With a global GDP of $100T, $1B market cap for a v=100 token would be fair value iff 0.1% of global GDP is happening on IOTA  So why is IOTA not massively overvalued? Even if IoT reaches $5T annually within 5 years, and 100% of that is happening on IOTA, it would still be at best 50x higher than now at equilibrium (assuming v=100, it could be even higher).

3964,1,"In my opinion, there is a lot of potential in novel advertising concepts now that data sourcing is becoming a much more peer-to-peer between companies and consumers. Personal Data Privacy is quickly becoming realized as a fundamental human right, and this presents an opportunity to devise a medium that connects advertiser and consumer.  The method in which I think Iota can prosper is by merging this concept with their Autonomous driving initiatives.  Take for example, Jaguar Land Rover is now using Iota to award car owners for the data recorded by the car.   What if someone created a medium, let‚Äôs say an app like uber or postmates, on top of the tangle that connects advertiser and consumer. The advertiser could pay iota directly to the consumer for viewing there ad.  Taking it a bit further, I think integrating this into autonomous vehicles would create a great way for Iota to enter the advertising industry.  While people pay in Iota to use an autonomous car for ride sharing, they could also look at some sort of screen on a dashboard in the car that displays adds.  Just some food for thought...Iota could create the protocol that facilitates this market, using autonomous cars as the entry, and eventually be payment layer for P2P data sourcing.",Possible use-case for Iota to contemplate: P2P Advertising?

4014,1,"I will try to make this an objective post and not just shill my bags.  So, what I am arguing for is that IOTA will be able to become THE tamper-proof messaging and payments protocol that will be used by hundreds or even thousands of small and large corporations from all around the globe.  The first point is: do corporates actually need such a solution? The main value proposition of IOTA is that companies will need a solution to stream granular data in a auditable and tamper-proof way, usecases for this can be anything from supply chain tracking, to energy management to datamerketplaces. There are many reports from McKinsey and Co. outlining how important these industries will be in the future and how big the potential market is for a solution to these problems. I think its quite obvious that there is a demand for such services, if not convinced just watch ""100billion reasons why"" by the bIOTAsphere.  But will IOTA be the solution that will satisfy these needs?  In my view there are 3 reasons why IOTA will become the market leader:  **1) Better technology**: to become the leader IOTA needs to have the better tech than all competitors, only this way corporate will use IOTA instead of alternatives. So the question is does IOTA have the best tech on the market? I think the answer is ""not yet but very soon"". As we all know the Tangle is still in its infancy and in its current state it totally unusable for an actual use case. But having a network with ""training wheels"" gave the IF the chance to become the leading institution in DAG research, they now this field better than anyone else, they have the best researches, and they have been working on the problems that DAG architectures face for over 3 years now. And that what allowed the IF to come up with the Coordicide solution. I don't know of any competitor who can show a similar amount of expertise, and these projects will all have to solve the same problems, while IOTA already solved them. In conclusion I think that the experience and know-how that the IF accumulated over the years gives them a unique advantage to bring to the market the best solution.  **2) Market Adoption:** As with all network based systems adoption is key, the value of the network is fully depended on how many people are in it, the more people are already in the bigger the incentive for new people to join. Here again IOTA has a huge advantage over competition. Even though there are no ""real"" applications on IOTA yet there have been many PoCs  with big corporations, this means that 1) these corporations know that IOTA is a potential solution, 2) they have experience in implementing IOTA based solutions, 3) they know what the issues are when implementing a DLT based solutions. So this gives IOTA a big advantage over the competitions as for a competitor to be integrated into a PoC they need to prove that they have a such superior solution (which they probably dont, see point 1) that it is worth it to the company to put the money and effort into integrating it. In conclusion it will always be more valuable for a company to go with a solution that they have worked with before and that other companies are using as well.  **3) STANDARDIZATION:** I can't stress enough how big of a deal this is. As IOTA was the first mover they reached a level of maturity on tech, adoption and organization that made it plausible for them to apply to become an ISO standard (having Dr. Richard Soley onboard helped too). The entire point of a standard is that EVERYONE uses that and not something else. This basically means that its GG for IOTA. No corporation looking for a solution will go with some newcomer instead of an established ISO standard. And even today the fact that IOTA already started this process made it WAY more likely that someone like JLR chose IOTA for their PoC, as they know that in 1.5 years this protocol will be the one everyone uses. In conclusion you CAN NOT COMPETE WITH AN ESTABLISHED STANDARD.  So, to conclude this rant, I can see no way that another solution will dominate this market, IOTA is already far to advanced on R&amp;D and Market adoption for anyone else to catch up. The ISO Standardization makes it impossible for an ""IOTA-Killer"" to gain any relevance even before the process is complete. The huge impact of the network effect in communication and financial tech makes it a winner-take-all situation, and for me its clear that IOTA is the winner.",Why IOTA will succeed

4067,1,"   ## Internet Of Things-  So as to use innovation to initiate business development, one needs to watch out for technological expansion. In this way many organizations are advancing by identifying the next ‚Äúbig thing‚Äù.¬†¬†     To overcome the problems and achieve smoother flow in a business, eventually, every business needs to use data management tools, network control, and intelligent solutions. It is difficult to recognize the perfect technology that best suits your business requirements. Extensively, IoT, big data analysis, the cloud will bring significant changes in business process management.  [**IoT(Internet of things)**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/internet-of-things/) **is all about synchronized and connected environments across the system. This includes the integration of microservices, web, wireless technology, sensors, and devices.**  Here Node.js comes into the picture. For the IoT application development, most systems failed to provide a uniform experience across the devices and real-time reflection through embedded systems.     ### Rapid growth-  The popularity of [**Node.js**](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/use-of-node/) is rapidly increasing, but no one expected it would grow this quickly. Node.js is built on Google‚Äôs V8 open source JavaScript engine. Node.js is known for its speed, scalability and efficiency. This makes it ideal for developing data-intensive, real-time applications. So Node.js best for the IoT, which is depend on data-intensive, real-time devices and applications. Effective and secure communications and interactivity are of fundamental significance in the IoT, which is the very reason why APIs lend themselves so well to the IoT model. The most widely accepted use case for Node.js is API- For example, the first thing LinkedIn built in Node.js was its mobile API.     ### What Makes the Node.js a Great Choice for IoT Applications?     There are many frameworks such as Hapi, Express and Restify designed for creating APIs in Node.js. Even without a powerful pre-built solution, it takes only a few lines of code to get an API started using Node.js. Devices within the IoT, such as sensors, beacons and wearables**,** generate large number of requests. Node.js is perfect for managing these requests via streams that can be processed and monitored very efficiently. Stream instances are basically Unix pipes. They can be readable, writable or both, and are easy to work with. Streams allow users to pipe requests to each other, or stream data directly to its destination. No caching, no temporary data‚Äìjust stream from one place to another.  It‚Äôs also essential to note that the Node.js community likes IoT technologies, and early adopters of IoT have a tendency to use Node.js for experiments and products. In fact, the Node Packaged Modules (NPM) repository is an indicator of the association between these communities. It consists of more than 80 packages for the Arduino controller. And over 15 for Bluetooth Low Power, and multiple packages for the Pebble and Fitbit wearable devices.  Node.js also has very low resource requirements. This is a feature that developers are already using in data-intensive IoT scenarios. From wearables to M2M, Node.js is best for IoT. The bottom line is that developers building data-intensive, real-time IoT applications says that Node.js is a best fit.  Indeed, with its proven performance and the simplicity with which an API code base can be maintained, Node.js fits the IoT use case very well.  ## Best practices to keep in mind when planning an API-first architecture for the IoT with Node.js:  Read more at-  [https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/role-of-node-js-in-internet-of-things-iot/](https://solaceinfotech.com/blog/role-of-node-js-in-internet-of-things-iot/)",Role of Node.js in Internet of things (IoT)

4073,1,"For a current use case of mine I want to have a simple and cost effective communication from roaming sensors to the internet.  I've considered LoRaWAN using The Things Network, but contrary to what I expected, this is not a global free-to-use network of public LoRaWAN nodes, which means that you need to have contracts for each willing gateway if you want to communicate over one.  Then I considered resorting to GPRS, for which there are some globally usable SIM cards which cost money upfront for each device, and some data bundle on top of that. GPRS will be phased out, moving to LTE or multiple technologies means more expensive hardware and more difficulties with coverage.  This gave me the idea of having a mobile app with a BLE to MQTT gateway, where you can allow IoT devices to communicate over your internet connection. This would of course not have a continuous global coverage, but if enough people install this app, it would at least have periodic coverage in populated areas. The incentive to let an IoT device use your connection could be to be paid per forwarded message.  Since the use case would be for IoT devices, IOTA could be used for payment and IOTA would be helped with a world where connected IoT devices can be deployed easily and globally, I thought I'd ask here what your thoughts are on this idea, whether such a thing makes sense and if someone has already created something with this idea.

I took some time to translate it roughly.   &amp;#x200B;  I'll abbreviate her with M.  &amp;#x200B;  The other male person with H (Host).  &amp;#x200B;  And there's another person talking near the end I call O (Other).  &amp;#x200B;  M: In Holland we do a lot to stimulate public transport but if it's up to Janguar Land Rover you should just continue driving.  Because they are doing a test/pilot where you will be paid when you take your car for a ride.  H: I have a Jaguar so tell me how I can start earning money!  M: Well it's sounds a bit nicer than it is and that is also the case.  The company applies a new smart technology called the smart wallet and currently only the models Jaguar FP and Land Rover Range Rover Velar will be equipped with it.  These models will automatically gather information about your location, travel conditions, battery status but also traffic jams and potholes, but here is the catch. Because all this information can be forwarded to your navigation system or local authorities.  So you are paid for sharing of data. But apart from this privacy aspect which you can debate about there is another reason why this new system is being talked about a lot.  Because instead of being paid in Bitcoin or Euros you are getting paid in the token IOTA.  H: Hang on, so your car gathers data and this is personalized because they need to know how to pay you, but IOTA, what is that?  M: IOTA is something different than Bitcoin also called the Internet of Things currency. Bitcoin runs on computers and they verify transactions and then those are added to the blockchain. But with IOTA that uses the Tangle and that's not a chain of blocks but a large pile of data so all data is put on that large pile and what is very nice about it is that IOTA has 0 transaction costs and next to that is capable of handling an infinite amount of transactions. So it is super suitable for microtransactions. So better than Bitcoin which is very expensive and better than the Euro.  And to be clear there is no Jaguar coin but it's the platform of IOTA which will use it's token for this machine economy.  Jaguar says you will also be able to earn tokens by joining things like carpooling but you will also be able to actually use those tokens again. For instance for toll roads, parking or charging your batteries.  So you get a parallel economy.  You car can earn and pay money by itself.  H: So like a driving bank?  M: Yes indeed.  H: Well then it's called a Bank Rover.  All: lol hahah roflol.  H: Ok so when do these cars come to market?  M: Well that's not really known yet but from the press release I can understand that there is a lot of attention was given to the testing and they are really continuing this development. So it seems the world tomorrow is coming closer and closer.  O: Well so being Jaguar you already have to convince people to share their data, which will be a bit hard to do. And then you also need to convince people to it will be IOTA and what that actually is and means.  H: Oh but I wouldn't even do that, I would just say: the next time you are at a tollbooth in France you don't have to pay, because your car is doing that for you.  M: Very smart.  O: Ah yes, then I understand.",Jaguar Land Rover news in well known Dutch morning news radio show (+ translation)

This takes ages and it is very very likely that you make mistakes during the process.  So my idea is to have a ""I am a normal guy"" tool in Trinity or a HTML file with hardware wallet support that moves all incoming value transactions above 100 dollar to seperate adresses.

4254,1,"Can IOTA **potentially** be used to save a short message in a transaction and use the timestamp as proof of the existence of the message at that time?  I have to admit that the technical specs of IOTA are too complex for me to understand, but it has al least 2 appealing options for this use case: zero transaction fees and the message option (if I get this right). The use case would be similar to what Chainpoint (Tierion) does - attaching a checksum of a file to a blockchain for proof of existence of the file that the checksum was based on - but without the need to use (potentially expensive) bitcoin transactions for this.  It appears that currently, the IOTA [timestamps cannot be trusted](https://www.tangleblog.com/2019/02/09/ict-lightweight-implementation-iot-timestamps-ixi-interview-with-iotas-lukas-tassanyi/), but (hoping) that maybe that's just a matter of time or something that can be solved somehow?   The message I'd want to store is 64 char ascii, which can be [converted to trytes](https://tangletools.org/converter) and back.

After reading [https://blog.iota.org/consensus-in-the-iota-tangle-fpc-b98e0f1e8fa](https://blog.iota.org/consensus-in-the-iota-tangle-fpc-b98e0f1e8fa) I get the impression that Coordicide is getting much closer now and the IF's proposed solution is outlined and explained. The post reiterates the Coordicide grants, so that we can get outsiders to further improve the solution.   Also note, we have four 4 more months before the new hashing function bounty is up, so the chances are that will be used. So I would imagine Coordicide will not happen before this too.  Now for more my two questions:  1. As the IF want to nail Coordicide so its as good as it can get, does that mean when released, the protocol is locked in stone and can't be further updated? Or does it allow for updates to the protocol? 2. Does Coordicide mean that once released, IOTA will be production ready? If that's the case, from a marketing point of view, rather than telling the world that were all excited about something labelled 'Coordicide', surely being excited about \`IOTA production ready\` would make more sense, as know one needs to research what Coordicide means?",Coordicide discussion

4358,1,"Hello fellow Iota supporters,  I do not want to go over any other details than the arguments made. I am referring to the arguments made by Sara Jamie Lewis (SJL). I read the arguments she has made on her twitter and I was wondering if anyone here is able to explain to me (and other less technically savy people) what she means. I think I do understand some of it but I am not 100% sure as I do not have an IT background. I understand them in a very superficial matter and I think it would be beneficial to have a post where we discuss the arguments. Is there anybody that disagrees with (some of) the arguments and can provide an answer why? Are there people that fundamentally agree with (some of) the arguments and can provide an explanation? I want to clarify that I am a IOTA supporter and would like it to succeed. I understand that maybe not every argument is  refutable since some of these things are currently researched.  IOTA has always had the criticism that what it meant to construct is not possible. Coordicide brings the argument that it is possible, how much closer to possible are we compared to before Coordicide? What arguments has IOTA refuted with Coordicide and where remains doubt for the critics?  Her arguments are:  Iota needs both a   **#1: Complete list of the nodes and**   **#2: A globally verifiable randomness**  **#1 Complete list of nodes**  SJL says that a complete list of nodes is not possible because:  *""Ok first we need a complete list of iota nodes. We could have everyone ping a centralized node every time they come online (hmm we want to be decentralized), what if we hardcoded a list in the source code? (ah damn same problem), what if we multicast across the internet?! (hmm*)""  **1.1:** She says that gossiping is not the solution because a secure gossiping network can only exist if the consensus mechanism is secure:  *""(*[*https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/Quicksilver/public\_pdfs/2007PromiseAndLimitations.pdf ‚Ä¶*](https://t.co/GRvhMYjSIf)*) or you could go literally any distributed systems paper - but what you need to understand before we progress is this:  Gossips are as secure as the consensus mechanism. Not the other way around.""*  **1.2:** This is because you have to agree on the number of nodes:  *""If you have a secure consensus mechanism you can build a robust gossiping protocol that minimizes malicious distribution.   You can't build a secure consensus mechanism from a gossip network...because...say it with me...  You need to agree on the number of nodes!""*  **1.3:** The nodes are fundamental because without it there is no overview of the total size of the network, the distribution of conflicting information to verify against and security parameters.  *""Why is agreeing on # of nodes important? Because if you don't agree on the number of nodes, then you have no basis on which to trust a) the total size of the network b) the distribution of conflicting information to verify against c) your security parameters.""*  **#2 Globally verifiable randomness (Complete list of nodes is available)**  I will give this example as a full situation because I myself do not know which particular pieces are the core of the argument.   **The gedanken experiment example**  *""Let's do another science thing, a Gedankenexperiment or ""thought experiment"", and return to Alice buying her coffee from a coffee shop. Except this time it is her girlfriend Mallory, who is an anti-capitalist and would like some free coffee. Mallory creates two iota transactions, one for buying the coffee, and another where she sends the same funds to herself (Mallory doesn't care about her private key).  Can Mallory position herself within the network such that she can distort or delay consensus (&amp; get free coffee) So the coffee shop here has a couple of options. They can't seem to reach many of their verified random other parts of the tangle. There may even be a few transactions confirming Mallory's transaction, but it seems slower than usual.  Do they give Mallory the coffee? I've written a fuller outline of the trade-offs involved with the above scenario here:* [*https://fieldnotes.resistant.tech/dags-and-decentralization/ ‚Ä¶*](https://t.co/agd6OCy3gE) *tl;dr you either delegate trust to supernodes,  or you wait a (long) while.  Or you can assume the network is untamperable. I'm not a cop, assume what you want.""*  I am curious what you guys think.

4378,1,"     https://i.redd.it/ksmg6m903ug31.jpg  HoneyComb will be an IOTA-focused Embedded Linux Distribution meant to support IOTA Community‚Äôs most common needs for running the Tangle on  Embedded Linux environments. It will be created with the tools provided  by the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded.  The concept behind the HoneyComb name comes from the newcoming IOTA Ecosystem projects called Shimmer, Bee and Hornet. The honeycomb is where the beehives store their polen and produce their honey üêùüçØ.  Currently, the IOTA Community needs to rely on popular Distros such as Armbian or Raspbian for their Embedded Linux projects. All configurations have to be done manually, which can quickly become a nightmare. Also, these standard Distributions ship lots of software that will never be used by anyone in the community, unnecessarily inflating the OS footprint and stealing computing performance from IOTA applications.  With the current development of lightweight nodes such as cIRI, bee and hornet, there will soon be a rising demand for a reliable way to deploy these applications into Embedded Linux environments in a standardized and simple way. No one wants to spend hours with manual setting of network configs, daemons, user access, etc. It will be of great benefit for the community if there is a Distribution that delivers the most common configurations for Tangle applications out of the box.

I see the world as a sick, torn by contradictions and not using its potential thing.

Most people are disconnected from advanced science and technology by the states‚Äô borders, the boundaries of language, the boundaries in society. What if every person in the world would be integrated into unified development environment that would accurately see his capabilities and potential, recommend him a development direction and remove all restrictions for interaction with other participants in a unified developing community. The idea seems unreal, but haven‚Äôt we already crossed the threshold of the technical revolution with the development of neural networks and AI ?! I see that IOTA can be such a network that unites not only a network of things, but also a network of people. I see that a combination of neural networks and IOTA will be extremely popular and important. Neural networks need data, IOTA could provide it.

I tried to keep my composure but reptilian brain started to claim ownership of my thinking, and decided to bombard me with non-sensical reasons of what happened (e.g. the Foundation made the funds more difficult to access, to get hold of funds of inactive users).  Only today have I finally managed to remember the correct encryption key.  ==========================================  Please be careful with how you store the seeds.

For example: car charges at a charging station. Once charged, the tangle is used to send a data package from the station to the car saying ""that cost ‚Ç¨15"". The car then pays the fee with their credit card (Fiat) and not with an IOTA wallet.  In my opinion this will be the most common way IOTA is integrated with the regular world. You will still see sensors/robots and whatnot use IOTA for value transactions in order to e.g. buy computational power or data, but I mainly see IOTA acting as a communication layer to facilitate Fiat transactions.

I conclude: We all should create more non-hype pro-awareness content in social media.    There is no ""too early"" because things like the halvening are anticipated for months and months before, so it actually does make sense to create solid awareness now, if it's delivered with an educational core.      I'll try to focus on awareness with actual content instead of ""blockbuster-videos"" then. But I still keep the hourglass next to your name on social media, for merchandising reasons -and so should you :)     But let me express a wish I have: Everyone who has the time should do the same.

4549,1,"It seems like some people have a severely different stance of advertisement and hype than I do, because I received, apart from 90% agreement, also 10% very loud criticism, that I want to address here.      I have a blog (ca 2.8 million clicks), I do the 2 podcasts (without real schedule these days, because content I could use is kinda scarce), I advertise and push IOTA on Twitter. Not to mention the hundreds of emails I answer every month, but they are something different...     When I do Videos like ""Coordicide is coming"", similar articles or tweets I have just 2 things in mind.      \*\*a)\*\* create tension for something that has undoubtedly the potential to change crypto. Because I know that most people in crypto have zero ideas what the coordicide is, nor that IOTA is still a thing.      They basically stopped reading since the MIT-gate and are still fully convinced that IOTA is a scam, not working, snakeoil, etc.      My content aims at breaking through the echo-chamber that is a serious problem for IOTA.      Do an experiment. Tweet ""IOTA is the best"" and only tag #Bitcoin #TRX etc, not #IOTA. Then you can have a glimpse of what the rest of the world thinks. It's mind-blowing...  \*\*b)\*\* I want to ensure that speculators still have interest in IOTA because the daily volume is just a shadow of what it was, and the price speaks for itself.      Don't get me wrong, I'm financed and I'm not doing any of that for my own fast profit,... I'm here longer than most and I never sold any iotas of my stack. Just donations which I have to for tax-reasons and fridge-filling-reasons.      But creating content for IOTA is costly. Servers, royalty rights, just personal costs. Supporting IOTA is not for free, and I know at least 3 other parties in the ecosystem that told me repeatedly, that this isn't going on forever.      Last month, 1 projects did stop their services already, and I guarantee that this is going on, if we don't challenge that.      Also, the foundation needs funds for the next years. IOTA didn't win yet, we have no guarantee whatsoever that the IF is sustainable for the next years, and the ""high-horse-stance"" of ""we don't need hype, or speculators"" is pretty short-sighted.      It would be the \*\*much\*\* safer way to create more awareness and to support the markets with, yes I say it, hype.      We would get more supporters that way, more funding for developers, a \*\*way\*\* more happy ecosystem, but maybe that's just me...      Limo",Let's have a healthy discussion about hype.

4609,1,"While the new Trinity wallet is fantastic, there are a couple of reasons I'm pushed away from using it. I wanted to share these reasons with the community to see if there are like minded individuals out there who feel the same.  Reason A: No persisting receiving addresses.  Sending IOTA constantly to the same person is pretty inconvinient. You must first contact with them through some sort of communication means ( internet chat usually ) in order to get their available recieving address from them and only then are you able to send iota funds to them. If you so happen to want to send them payments again you have to go through that whole process again of getting the receiving address, which can take a while depending on how responsive those people are on said communication means. I've heard that IF is working on this but I don't know how true it is. I've thought about automatic solutions where you send a payment request to a user on their designated recieving address and you are returned with that persons next available recieving address, but there are a few drawbacks like: the reciever will need to leave trinity app open all the time for feature to work, and now there will be 6 transactions that would need to be confirmed between the sender and reciever instead of just 2.  Reason B: Takes way too long to enter into Trinity wallet due to long password requirements.  There will be times where I want to show off Trinity wallet to friends, but opening up the wallet on mobile devices is very daunting with those little mobile keyboards. I understand that this is a security measure but a Quick Access Wallet that has a IOTA cap would be nice. Perhaps it can be paired with a normal wallet so when you go over your IOTA cap of let's say 20 mIota, a big indicator comes up telling you to click here to send the overflow IOTA to the paired wallet.   I understand development takes time for things like these, but just wanted to share my experiences.","Trinity is great, but ...."

Although we have had some genuine concerns with how that sub is moderated, there was a tweet that was recently posted by CFB  that encourages the doxing of their mod team for a financial incentive. Obviously, we do not condone this type of behavior, and even condemn it. Likewise, the IF's official stance against doxxing is a consensus, especially given CFB's resignation and departure from the foundation being expedited to today. Whatever issues we have should always have a solution that does not involve putting bounties on people.

4645,1,"Hey guys,  Im having trouble understanding exactly how IOTA can communicate between one machine and another, and how its used. I have so many questions... So apologies in advance ;p  For example, how can someone communicate with my smart thermostats at home (one example I heard) to collect data on temperatures. How exactly is this done? Thermostats arnt usually designed for computing power so how can it collect data for someone who queries it? Does each device have it's own walllet somehow to transact?  What if I don't wish for someone to know the data of my thermostats? How exactly does me having IOTA tokens in a wallet allow for any such communication between any devices?  And lastly, how can it be adapted to transfer whatever data the user wants? As there are so many device's this question basically asks how will a machine know how much IOTA a particular type of data is worth and how will that other know exactly which data to query considering the vast number of devices and possibilities  I feel like the technology sounds great in theory but I'm having a difficult time grasping how it will actually function",Explain IOTA

For example, Bitcoin is both decentralized and secure, but critics have historically argued that it is not scalable. Luckily, Layer Two solutions are currently working to solve Bitcoin's scalability restraints and put an end to the Bitcoin trilemma.

I will also be personally focusing on other projects and will use my homeserver for those - all this time [PayIOTA.me](https://PayIOTA.me) has been running on my residential connection and my homeserver, again a symptom of not having the neccesary funds.   All the code is fully open-source and anyone can create his or her own PayIOTA.me-based software or service.

4731,1,,ard.de (biggest German TV news channel) question about IOTA in crypto-quiz
4732,1,,Test The Tangle Text - Markus - Medium
4733,1,"My name is Jev.  I‚Äôm an immigrant in Germany since 2010, and I love this country.  I‚Äôm Senior Sales, Project Management and Technological Executive specializing in Cloud and OpenSource, I have more than 18+ years of professional Hi-Tech experiences from such Giant companies as: D-Link, Verint, Huawei, Canonical, Redhat and many others. On Cebit in 2015 I was a keynote speaker about Huawei Cloud Strategy.  There are many coaches and mentors out there that would promise you to turn you from mise to lions and become business savvy in 4 weeks‚Äô time or less. But in fact, most of them will not give you any real means how to avoid hidden stones and pitfalls of real business problems.  Russians have a aphorism ‚ÄúCunning people learn on other people mistakes, clever people learn on their own mistakes, and stupid people do not learn on their mistakes. The main aim of this investigative article is to give you the tools to become Cunning and learn on my mistakes and use cases. It will give you real tools to avoid business financial pitfalls and hidden stones. As well as give you real preventive measures, and in case you read this while already in trouble it will give you some conflict resolution methods and what to do next.  So, lets imagine you have a company or you‚Äôre a self-employed freelancer. You‚Äôre selling your brains, your experience and expertise. After many years you‚Äôre considered an expert on the market and you sell yourself as time and material based on monthly fixed rate.  Let‚Äôs hypothetically imagine that you have a customer and you signed a very nice German contract with, that gives you 8000 euro per month fix rate for your services of what ever you‚Äôre good at and sell. Normally in a standard situation you will need to spent one month like this working for that individual and when it comes the end of the month send him an invoice with hope of getting payment for your services because you have mutual contract obligations to each others.  Unfortunately some customers even in Germany with all its nice rules and regulations are practicing modern slavery and will not be willing to pay you even thought you will have full legal right and proof for your work done.  So what to do to really avoid such pitfalls. The formula is very simple. Look deeply into your business partner, future employer and make a proper risk analysis, search the net, make proper due diligence, search Glasroor, Kununu, pay for Shufa, make a proper KYC do not save money on making a proper background check because absence of it can cause you severe harm in the future.  If you can‚Äôt in any way in any open or professional resources find any useful information about your future business partner/customer/employer then use some Agile methodologies to understand one simple answer to a question ‚ÄúWill this business partner/customer/employer really going to pay me what he owes me according to the contract‚Äù.  Use weekly or be-weekly sprint time frames to check if your business partner/customer/employer is willing and going to pay you. Another option is to ask for a down payment of 2‚Äì3 months or even one month down payment. You can easily justify this that you are practicing agile methodologies and you want to make sure you receive proper payment for your services and KPI‚Äôs as a businessman/company/freelancer that is why you want to receive the payment upfront or in a short timeframes, if your counterpart will disagree to that then RUN AWAY FAST!!!!  Its nice to talk hypothetically about things, but I want to bring to light a real situation that I‚Äôm unfortunately experiencing more than a year now in Germany, and I want to highlight the ways to overcome it, and how to become successful in a very frustrating unjust situation with customers that are just unwilling to pay for your services, for the work that was done already.  In every story there is always a good character and a villain, I will not intend to hide over villain and the full name of our Villain is Mr. Herman Frank. Mr. Herman Frank is a real person that is responsible for many companies such as: Singular Ventures GmbH, HyperMesh, and probably many others. Mr. Herman Frank is unhappy with me, for me opening my big mouth but I will do it anyway. I guarantee you my reader that the entire story is true and for each thing that I write here I have full bulletproof facts and evidence. I will be very polite and will give to Mr. Herman Frank full level of politeness because its nice to be important but its more important to be nice. Despite the fact that Mr. Herman Frank on multiple occasions humiliated me and called me by many names.  On 22 of February 2018 I was contacted by Mr. Herman Frank on my Linkedin page, the message looked like this: ‚ÄúDear Jevgenijs,I am currently assembling an advisory team for a new venture at the intersection of blockchain &amp; IoT/telco. Your experience would be an ideal fit. If you are interested to learn more I would love to connect and explore ways to work together. Best, Hermann‚Äù  The offer was tempting, we had several phone conversations with Mr. Herman Frank and indeed the project looked promising. I immediately put on the table that the minimum payment for my full-time services would be 10,000usd for a full time. Mr. Herman Frank didn‚Äôt even blink.  We met on 7th of March in Berlin, in shared office space, frankly, speaking it looked beyond terrible. Too many people and the atmosphere were chaotic completely. By that time, I knew the difference between a good and bad co-working and that one was the worst I seen so far in a Western European country. We had two meetings on the 7th and 8th of March on which we discussed the details, and all seems legitimate.  I had signed a contract with full time office-based obligation from my side to be Strategy Director for Singular Ventures GMBH as a Freelancer for 3 months contract term.  Mr. Herman Frank promised me that I will receive options and that after 3 month I will become employed in a new company that will be formed.  Strategy Director was part of the Senior Management team of the company, this was indeed very interesting and promising for me.  At that stage I used to work for Canonical the maker of Ubuntu Linux for several years now, The company had it‚Äôs challenges and I knew that I will not be staying for long after April 2017 when Canonical had massive layoffs.  The contract supposes to start on 1st of April, I had arrived to office in a completely new location which was Mindspace in Berlin. It was of course much better than the first co-working where I met Mr. Herman in Berlin during our meetings in March.  We had one single office room for 4 people, it was kind of crowded but still was much better.  I had spent 3 full working days at that office, during this time I had lots of thoughts on the back of my head regarding weather I‚Äôm doing the right thing all over again.  My Spiderman sense had told me to RUN AWAY!!!, My high sense of intuition had never let me down, but unfortunately, I‚Äôm not always listening to it. But during this time, I had listened to it very loud and clear.  After being in office for 3 days, I had left to never come back.  I came to this decision for several reasons: 1. In the back of my head I knew that I would have severe problems with Mr. Herman Frank because he will not pay me what he promised.  2. The job in Berlin required me to move with my wife and son from Dusseldorf to Berlin which was quite a hustle and to do such a career turn in my life would require something really tangible and not a one man and a dog startup with some one named Mr. Herman Frank that I do not know and do not trust.  3. I used to be out off office for customer meetings and home office jobs since 2013, its very hard to come back to an office atmosphere after something like that.  4. I had a very good offer from another company called Enecuum where one of my ex acquaintances used to work to become Senior Director CBDO in that company, and it was much more established and almost had a real product to sell.  I had reported sick leave to Mr. Herman Frank and took time to spent with Enecuum on their Blockchain journey to bright future, and started to represent them in Exhibitions, Conferences those required frequent traveling and I flew to Dubai for a Blockchain Conference.  During this time, I had also very high blood pressure problem. My blood pressure spiked to 172/109 and I was feeling terrible. I had sent a picture from my phone with my blood pressure of 172/109 to Mr. Herman Frank on 16th of April at 09:31 from Dubai to claim still sick leave.  Sick leave in Germany under a freelancer contract means that you just sick and not going to get any salary for this time, that means that this time that I took sick leave is not counted for anything and I will just not going to get paid for.  Mr. Herman Frank apparently took this picture of the blood pressure that I sent him, specifically looked for GPS tagging from the picture, and found by this the exact hotel location where I‚Äôm actually based in Dubai.  He had called the hotel and asked them to leave me a letter in my room requesting me to call him ASAP.  If this is not harassment and a compete violation of privacy and personal space, then what is??  I was frankly SHOCKED!!!  After this I immediately deleted my Facebook and all other social networks because I understood with whom I‚Äôm dealing with here.  On April 16th I sent a letter where I had requested to change the working environment in Singular Ventures GMBH for me I had come up to new conditions that included: Home office and responsibilities of Business Development Executive. We had several conversations about this with Mr. Herman Frank he agreed to this arrangement.  I had introduced him as a part of this job to Mr. Amit Cohen a good friend of mine and one of the world leaders in everything related to PaaS, Cloud and Mobile Networks.  Frankly speaking without Amit, Mr Herman Frank project would never took of.  On average a placement agency takes approximately 3‚Äì6 salaries for headhunting of an individual of such caliber as Amit for a company. So hypothetically if I to headhunt Amit Cohen for Mr. Herman Frank I would ask for it approximately around 30,000‚Äì60,000 euro. I had made this introduction as a part of my professional responsibilities because I was thinking Mr. Herman Frank is going to pay me my salary eventually.  I had also introduced several other individuals and created first high level draft of the product design for Mr. Herman Frank.  Amit had also brought his former boss from Huawei Dagan Gilat to this story, so we had an All stars team to start progressing on the minimum viable product and bring it to the market.  I had clearly explained to Mr. Herman Frank that his project is not the only one on which I‚Äôm working and that in parallel I still have a project from Enecuum and I sent him clear list of my responsibilities and key performance indicators on which we agreed upon.  Moreover I saw that Mr. Herman Frank doesn‚Äôt trust me so I had myself proposed a framework that is called ‚Äúidonethis‚Äù to calculate and see in the cloud the progress that I‚Äôm doing and how my remote working days are passing by.  The time had passed, I reported almost on a daily basis, added about 700 contracts of possible investors in Salesforce, reported what I was doing in Idonethis platform, all this time I was in contact with Mr. Herman Frank he never said to me that the contract is breached, that I‚Äôm fired, he didn‚Äôt send me any letters of messages that we need to finalize our commercial relationship or something.  On the 13th of June I got a message from Mr. Herman Frank that he and the team of 3 employees moved out of Mindspace co-working. This sparked some doughs into me, and I started to realize that those moves all the time from one office place to another one can be a pattern that is used by fraudsters in order to avoid lawsuits and they used every time different physical or virtual address.  We met in Berlin on 21st of June, by this time Mr. Herman Frank already supposed to pay me 3 installments of 4 figure salary every month starting April.  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt received even one euro-cent or expenses for my trips to Berlin or any other locations that were done on the business of Singular Ventures. On 21st of June I had raised the topic of payment of my renumeration according to the contract with Mr. Herman Frank.  I needed to do this like a beggar, despite the fact that Mr. Herman Frank needed to pay on his own behalf every month to me renumeration according to the contract I needed to chase him and ask for payment.  At that moment of his response I got to understand that all my assumptions and precautions measures were correct. Mr. Herman Frank by the way is driving a 200,000 euro worth of Porche, and while we were driving in his car he told me that he is not willing to pay me anything more than 7,000usd, even though that in fact he owed me by that moment according to a German contract 24,000 euros. This was more than disappointing; I was frankly shocked. But I knew now with whom I‚Äôm dealing with so I agreed to this compensation on the spot just to get something for the work done and then I will say FAREWELL to never hear or see again Mr. Herman Frank.  The new office location of Singular Ventures that Mr. Herman Frank sent to me was Strassburger str 9e 10405 Berlin. That was on July 1.  By July 1st the sum accumulated already to 5 figures that Mr. Herman Frank owed me according to German Contract and German Law.  We met again on July 3rd already on the new address, this was basically an apartment block with no mentioning whatsoever of ‚ÄúSingular Ventures GMBH‚Äù as one of its tenants.  Mr. Herman Frank is using rented apartment of 3 rooms as a business address of Singular Ventures, but there is no mentioning whatsoever that Singular Ventures is one of the tenants of the house.  I can only assume that this is illegal and the only tenant which is connected to Singular ventures on this house is Mr. Herman Frank his family name is indeed can be clearly seen as one of the tenants in the house.  We had a meeting again, where Mr. Heman Frank told me that he would like that I will switch from full time to 50% position in Singular Ventures due to this fact he sent me a contract where my renumeration changed from 10,000usd per month to only 5,000usd.  Plus we agreed that I will carry on me some samples of Intel based micro-computers to Israel to perform some tests there, the complete structure of Intel based micro-computers, the Lime Microsystems Wireless open source chips and all other things that I took to Israel to Amit Cohen and Dagan Gilad was my baby and my proposal in the first place.  Going back to conclusion of my storyline, I had inspected the new 50% contract and tried to gain some kind of leverage over Mr. Herman Frank that was clearly not acting according to his contract obligation in place by trying verbally to avoid payment of 24,000euro changing it to only 7,000usd ‚Äî I have all of this in written WhatApp form in Mr. Herman Frank message from July 5th 2018 sent by him at 16:13. So In the new contract I had requested my Herman Frank to pay me 7000usd plus pay me a down payment of 5000usdx3 months which is equals to 22000USD this is 19,524 euros. This sum is still short of 5000usd that Mr. Herman Frank owed me, but it clearly would allow me to have a big leverage over him.  After my request on July 23th 2018 at 15:48 Mr. Herman Frank had disconnected me from the company network and email, at first he pretended that it‚Äôs some kind of Google technical problem but on July 31st 2018 after I tried many times to call him and sent him multiple WhatApp messages he replied that he intentionally cut me off the company network and that I‚Äôm no longer employed by Singular Ventures. On a WhatApp message that he sent me on 31st of July he implied that he doesn‚Äôt even owe me now 7,000USD that he promised to pay me for the work that was done by me. And that he is willing to pay men this amount only for results and contacts that I gathered as part of my work for Eneccum. This is a clear request to perform a corporate espionage breach and violation for which I also have a clear evidence of.  Currently one year had passed since those times, I had hired a lawyer to take care of this issue.  He sent several letters to latest address known to me of Singular Ventures that is: Strasburger str 9E, Berlin. All of which came back with ‚Äúwrong address‚Äù notice from German post. Clearly Mr. Herman Frank is hiding behind fake address.  Moreover, on several occasions in WhatApp during this year Mr. Herman Frank committed acts of verbal abuse and several attempts to humiliate me calling me all sort of names.  The letter from my lawyer had reached Mr. Herman Frank but he is clearly avoiding payment of any sort and is not taking responsibility for his promises or contracts.  I would like to bring to public attention that Mr. Herman Frank is practicing MODERN SLAVERY in 2018, which is very similar to what HUGO BOSS and other alleged companies were doing to JEWS during NAZI German and second world war. Apparently its completely legal and above the law to practice modern slavery in Germany its allowed only to Mr. Herman Frank.  Also, on our latest telephone calls he was threatening me and tried to hush me, He said that he will sent some kind of letter from his lawyers to my current employer. And that I‚Äôm blackmailing him with very bad company reviews on Google Maps and that I will share all this story to the Public.  Mr. Hemran Frank you‚Äôre in a wrong business you should invent fairy-tales, the definition of Blackmailing is that I request you to pay money that you don‚Äôt owe me by trying to put into light some kind of incriminating information.  But on the contrary I‚Äôm trying to make you pay what you owe me according to contract and law, and I will definitely want to bring this to light because I don‚Äôt want that anyone else would suffer from your actions in Germany or in any other country in the world.  So bottom line my recommendation to deal with Business partners that doesn‚Äôt want to pay you what you deserve according to the law:  1. If you have doubts use Agile 1‚Äì2 week sprints that your customer would need to pay you for. That way early on the way you will understand if there is a sense to continue to work.  2. Another option could be to request a clear down payment for 1‚Äì3 months in order to have leverage.  3. Always clearly record your work progress and report this progress on a daily basis to your customer, a good way to do this is [https://idonethis.com/](https://idonethis.com/?source=post_page---------------------------)  4. If you way passed that turning point and you know your customer will not pay you hire a German lawyer to send notice to that customer. You can use remotely from your home a website service called Jurato, its an online platform to receive consulting and hire lawyer in Germany. Another good advice would be to have a German Lawyer insurance in place, there are many companies that provide this service.  5. There is a process via court that called ‚ÄúDas gerichtliche Mahnverfahren ‚Äú in this process the court sends official reminder to your customer to pay his depth. If he is not resisting within two weeks‚Äô time the court passing decision in favor of you and you can request the court to send clear DEMAND for your customer to pay the depth or his bank account will be blocked and there would be other consequences up to blocking of free movement etc.. But if the customer officially writes official resistance of payment then you will need to file a civil court lawsuit.  6. Civil Court Lawsuit only with German Lawyer  7. Inkassounternehmen ‚Äî You can turn in any point also to German collection company and just completely outsource all this process to them, but it will cost you approximately 50% of the cost.  8. As prevention measurement you can also consider NEVER EVER TO WORK WITH SMALL COMPANIES!!! ‚Äî THEY ALWAYS HAVE PAYMENT ISSUES.  9. If you are based not in Germany and you need to send online a registered letter to your villain you can always use letterxpress service for sending registered letters online.  10. You can always file also official police complaint online without going anywhere, in my case I had filed two official police complaints against Singular Ventures and Mr Herman Frank with Berlin Police [www.internetwache-polizei-berlin.de](http://www.internetwache-polizei-berlin.de/?source=post_page---------------------------) and [Hamburg police](https://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Landesregierung/POLIZEI/eRevier/Onlinewache/html/Onlinewache.html?source=post_page---------------------------)  11. If you are not speaking German but you have to fill out documents and complaints and communicate with German lawyer, villain or other authorities you can use the following translation service is much better than Google Translate [https://www.deepl.com/translator](https://www.deepl.com/translator?source=post_page---------------------------)  Hope this information was indeed helpful for you.

For example, would all the research done with ""split Tangles"" still be applicable or would there need to be further testing and research around that again?  &amp;#x200B;  \- If a protocol re-write is occurring, would it be fair to say we are pretty much back to 2017 as far as network stability goes?  That is, wouldn't there need to be a lead time of at least 6-12-months before you would attempt to go live with the network that holds ""live IOTAs"" to ensure you can circumvent attacks?  Would the network also need some sort of bootstrapping/coordinator-type solution that prevents any attacks or would this have this somehow mostly been determined during the test-net phase?  &amp;#x200B;  \- Is there any actual code that has been written for Coordicide as of right now or is the ""we solved it"" video referring purely to the mathematical proof that there should be a programmatic solution?  &amp;#x200B;  If we could have a discussion around this, I'm sure it would help followers of this project to have a deeper understanding of what the plan is with this part of the project.  &amp;#x200B;  Thanks!",Coordicide: A complete re-write of the protocol?

Many are pointing out that 24 word seed phrases exist. Yes, everyone is aware of this, thank you. We're still left with massively less secure wallets, the need to port all our funds over to new wallets if we can find secure ones, AND a $100 Ledger that is now bricked.

I created my Trinity wallet with the Ledger Nano S, so I have not the seed to restore the wallet funds directly. Since I cannot access because of **Trinity says that my password is not correct**, but it is not possible because I saved the password in a password manager, I was thinking of *restoring the wallet* and to generate a new wallet and recover it with the Ledger and the index number provided by the app the first time I created my wallet with Trinity.

The one important thing that happened in the meantime and that made me realize that Bitcoin is not going away is WBTC, aka bitcoin wrapped into Ethereum tokens. The bitcoin blockchain is slow, by today's standards badly designed, but afaik it's going to stay with us for a looong time and the scalability is going to be a achieved by wrapping it into other blockchains through probably centralized merchants. Funnily enough, the Ethereum blockchain is starting to hit the same fees as bitcoin.  That said, I think the best thing that could happen to IOTA from that perspective is to wrap bitcoin/satoshis into colored tokens and become a vehicle for proper Bitcoin scalability. That would bring a lot of attention and traffic to IOTA.

But IOTA seems to never have them.  This means it never develops the fat to deal with the attrition of the snakes... so inevitability it will fall down the rankings.  I think we could drop out of the top 50 in the next few weeks, and out of the top 100 by the spring, without necessarily losing dollar value.

5026,0,,HELLO GUYS WELCOME TO OUR NEW OPPORTUNITY CRYPTO INSVEMENT TRADING THAT CAN HELP YOU IN FUTURE AND GET BEST RESULTS!!! JOIN NOW
5027,0,"Hey ..... I can see you‚Äôre passionate about the protocol, and you see that it has potential, but have suffered losses through the token performance. I understand that, and I know how losses are never something someone looks forward to.  2/ You have a few things right. The key among them being the need for simplicity. The crypto/blockchain/DLT space is highly complex and difficult to bring non-technical people into due to the level of depth and breadth that some of the work entails.  3/ For most, making that simple and telling the ‚ÄúSo What?‚Äù, can be just as hard as building the tech. We at the IOTA Foundation have not done well at this traditionally.  4/ We started as a far spread-out group of believers that wanted to dedicate ourselves to making the vision of what the IOTA protocol can accomplish a reality.  5/ We came from an eclectic background, almost entirely of technical peoples, and focused on Build first, talk later. And many of us got heated in our public conversations, and handled things that were far from graceful, and often times quite the opposite.  6/ I‚Äôve been working with the Foundation since December 2017. I was not involved in the beginning of the protocol or the leadership of the Foundation early on. I have not been savvy to any of the internal conversations of the original members of the Foundation that preceded me.  7/ I came from a US Military and federal government background working in cyber security, signals analysis, and operations.  8/ I was used to structure, leadership, efficient and informed decision making, and an effort to be pragmatic, and realistic, and to take every step with purpose and enough information to trust in the decisions you‚Äôre making.  9/ I discovered IOTA while doing research for how to design efficient chain of custody processes and how to create more secure holistic systems. I gained interest in the protocol around one specific capability that it offers, that I didn‚Äôt see with anything else.  10/ Value, and Data are treated as equal. I highlight this in an effort to do what you ask, and explain simply, why you, and others, should care. When I looked at every other DLT on the market, I had a problem seeing how they could actually DO anything.  11/ They all suffered from the same problems. They tied everything to value, or the token, that formed the basis of their DLT. And all they cared about was who had control over that token and decentralizing it.  12/ This hit huge barriers from my perspective, because scaling BTC to 8 billion people wasn‚Äôt feasible, and the time to transfer funds if everyone was using it were not realistic for a product that aimed at going into production with global adoption.  13/ Or as you say about IOTA, BTC was not a working product that could reach global adoption based on its original goals.  14/ And I will argue this is still true, hence it‚Äôs narrative transitioning to a store of value replacing gold, and not that of being the currency the world needs to ensure things like the financial crisis of 2008 doesn‚Äôt happen again.  15/ I agree with its current narrative. It‚Äôs taken a strong pivot from the purpose it was originally designed for. And I think using it as a store of value makes perfect sense.  16/ From my perspective, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs gotten traction. Because the ‚ÄúSo What?‚Äù for BTC is finally simple, and finally makes sense. 11+ years later.  17/ Now, for IOTA, I saw that it answered a question that was a major barrier for BTC, ETH, and pretty much every other option in the space aside from NANO  18/ How can build something, that can accomplish the goals of what blockchain technology and Bitcoin was supposed to do but design it in a way that can achieve scale and potentially reach global adoption.  19/ Second to that, going back to my key interest, value and data are treated equal. So, can we build something that scales, that runs on the first principles of blockchain, and enable it to actually do something MORE.  20/ It has to do something GREATER, than just send value over a network in a trusted way with no central authority to restrict your freedoms or personal rights. This is great, but it's not enough.  21/ If all we‚Äôre concerned with is sending money to each other, and BTC can‚Äôt do that at a global scale, then it‚Äôs all pointless and a waste of resources.  22/ And is all we hope for in life really the ability to send others money? Is that the impact you want to dedicate your life to in the world and the stake you put in the ground?  23/ With my past, this didn‚Äôt interest me. I didn‚Äôt care about financial systems, because from my eyes, when I paid for something, it was paid for, and when I needed money, it was available. But doing something more. Something that could really make an impact interested me. ALOT  24/ So much so, that I quit a highly secure job working in an industry with a salary that would provide my family and I with comfort for as long as I needed. A job, that I am sure I could never go back to due to the restrictions put in place to even get there in the first place.  25/ / I, and others working at the Foundation have sacrificed magnitudes more in value, than the losses you have suffered. I took a big pay cut, and a big benefit cut, like many others.  26/ And I did it because I wanted to do something more, and work on something that could truly make an impact on every single person if it could be done right, accomplish its vision, and do it at scale.  27/ We‚Äôre a small foundation, and we‚Äôve worked tirelessly for years to make the absolutely monumental progress we have in the technology. We‚Äôve rid it of inefficiencies. We‚Äôve solved the problems we set out to. And now we‚Äôre building the last pieces we need to bring it to reality.  28/ I personally have worked multiple weeks with over 100 hours put in, and I know MANY others that have done the same.  29/ This was not done to simply, serve our investors. We are a nonprofit foundation, that holds less than 5% of the token from which it was founded. So, to get something straight, WE DO NOT SERVE YOU.  30/ We serve a reality for a better future where trust can be implicit in how we interact with each other. And where those that take advantage of others can be held accountable.  31/ We serve and sacrifice, so that people that don‚Äôt have hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest in digital money like yourself, have a better way. They can own their own identities. They can manage their own finances.  32/ They can reach audiences, have access to new opportunities, and take the steps to better their lives. We serve the world, and every person and machine in it, because we‚Äôre fucking tired of seeing people get taken advantage of.  33/ And we‚Äôre tired of people crying that they made an investment, and it didn‚Äôt work out as they planned as fast as they wanted it to. So when you say we serve you and our investors. Try to keep in mind that we don‚Äôt. We don‚Äôt have investors. We have donors.  34/ We don‚Äôt have shares. We‚Äôre a nonprofit for a reason. We don‚Äôt hold the majority of our token for a reason. I can‚Äôt speak for my predecessors, and I will not get mixed up in any of their personal matters, but I can speak for myself and this is why I‚Äôm here.  35/ Now, when you say we don‚Äôt have a working product. I'd say that you have not been looking close enough, and this is not your fault.  36/ It‚Äôs hard to understand everything we‚Äôre doing and how it all works. We‚Äôre different, we don‚Äôt fit into a predefined box of how a blockchain works and what it‚Äôs for. We Are More.  37/ Our layer 1, or core protocol, send data, and value. At the same rate. At the same cost. Which is Zero. And with as minimal resources as possible. For example, as of 2018, you could send over 5 million IOTA transactions, for the cost of 1 US Cent ($0.01 USD) in energy usage.  38/ And the protocol is exponentially more efficient now. Why does it matter that we can send data and value, efficiently, in near real time, and more securely than traditional networks. Well, lets put this back into the ‚ÄúSo What?‚Äù about blockchain in general.  39/ I wasn‚Äôt interested in others, because I didn‚Äôt see what you could do if everything were tied to value. I didn‚Äôt see why value tokens had any actual value; other than traditional simplistic concepts of economics, being supply and demand, fungibility, inflation etc.  40/ However, with IOTA, I saw something different. With the ability to do data, and value, on the same network, from the same devices, you could do more. You could use data, to give the value a purpose.  41/ I can send 1000 data transactions from a device. That data has value. And on the same network, I could very simply directly provide value, for the data.  42/ This means that the token isn‚Äôt providing the value anymore. The network is. The users are. The companies are. And they can all be fairly, and efficiently paid for that value by those that consume it.  43/ Regardless of whether they were in the US, Canada, Costa Rica, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, the Philippines, Kenya or Japan or wherever.  44/ If you had access to a device, and you could connect to a network for a few minutes a day, then someday, you‚Äôd be able to create value through your everyday actions to the world, and be fairly compensated for it.  45/ You could build businesses, and entire industries that are completely outside of anything we see today with these abilities, and you could take a bit of that power back, and have some control over your life, how you live it, and even where you live it.  46/ This is something that can be done TODAY. Not in 5 or 10 years. And this is something we work tirelessly on building every single day at the IOTA Foundation. Because it‚Äôs MORE. And it MATTERS. And it has the potential to make a real impact.  47/ This is why we have over a dozen grant funded projects by various governments, including Canada, Chile, multiple EU nations, Japan, Kenya, and more. This is why we have over 100 partners that we are actively working with that pay us to develop with them.  48/ This is what we can do with our layer two applications. Like IOTA Streams, Identity, Stronghold, Access, and soon Smart Contracts and our Firefly wallet. If you haven‚Äôt read the releases on them. Then I‚Äôd advise you catch up.  49/ Because they explain the so what, and it‚Äôs bigger than sending some money to someone and satisfying ‚Äúinvestors.‚Äù We are NOT here to serve you. We are not here for Investors. We are here for MORE.  50/ We are here to make something real. That makes an IMPACT. We have multiple revenue streams. And I would predict that by the end of 2021 we will be remove any reliance on the token.  51/ But you have something right. We need to do better. We need to explain things simpler. We need to show the proof of everything we‚Äôre building.  52/ And I‚Äôve been working on this personally over the last year with the product releases and with other IF leaders by restructuring how we do things internally from the ground up.  53/ So expect to see simplicity. I‚Äôll be working with others to write up a ‚ÄúSo What‚Äù on the changes we‚Äôve made to the protocol through Chrysalis with most likely weekly releases starting the second week of January.  54/ I‚Äôll also be working with others to write up a simplified vision document. Explaining the so what of the protocol. Why it matters. How its MORE. And how it aims to do something real and make a real IMPACT.  55/ This is not because of you, as I‚Äôve been working toward this for some months. But I thank you for the push to talk about it publicly. This is not something I‚Äôve been good at due to my past. But something I‚Äôve been getting better at and will continue to do with more fervor.  56/ Now, I‚Äôm going to be spending the following days enjoying my holidays with my family. And getting ready to continue doing something more with a protocol that‚Äôs better.  57/ Working with a team that I have the highest possible regard for, and partners that are here because they believe in the same vision that I and the rest of the IF do. If you can't now see that vision, then you don't belong in our community, and we will not cater to you.  (p.s. I'm so proud to actually witness this. I have been following IOTA for the last 3,5 years and it has been amazing to see the tech and the foundation mature!

5040,0,"...there won't be another altcoin bullrun. Why? Because the last one was based on pure hype and there are very few legit crypto projects in this space. Just an inordinate number of scam Ponzi schemes. Almost all of the ERC20 coins are useless clones. The BTC forks are also a waste of time, DeFi is a joke, and BTC itself fails to deliver its original promise. That said, it still rules the roost and this doesn't look set to change any time soon. It's pathetic that altcoin holders are STILL relying on BTC runs to make money from baseless hype, 3 years after the last cycle. Very little technological advancement has been made, there is virtually no real world adoption, and the use cases haven't been compelling enough to entice enterprise. Unfortunately for the moonboys and con-artist shillers, there isn't much dumb retail money left in crypto. Too many people have been burnt these past few years. Now it's about institutional money and they sure as hell aren't going to invest in shady altcoins that have no purpose and don't even work!  Back to IOTA, everything pre this year was a disaster. The IF have started again from scratch - which has been pretty farcical - and trust is now very low given the historical mistruths about JINN, Qubic, ternary, coordicide delivery, and so on. I think - and actually hope - that any BTC run sucks the life out of the alts market and kills 99% of those scams. It's the only way to stop this greed based lunacy and give the genuine projects a stable environment in which to grow and prosper. We hope that IOTA is one of the few that can make it but for me the jury is still out on that one and I've been very unimpressed with the IF's behaviour and comms both this year and in the past.

5048,0,"IOTA/BTC has been trading very reliably in a channel for more than one year. The channel is heading slightly downwards, meaning IOTA has been in a downtrend against BTC. However, right now IOTA is touching the bottom of the channel, suggesting that it might double in Satoshi over the next couple months.  If we look at IOTA/USD. We see that IOTA has been in accumulation mode for the past 2 years. The level to watch for the start of a massive bull run is 45 cent.  With BTC being bullish on every time frame right now and IOTA expected to appreciate against BTC over the next few months (as argued earlier), we can expect to break above the 45 cent level in the near future. Once we retest that level from above to establish it as support, IOTA will be set for a massive rally. Looking at longer term moving averages we are already tilting upwards, which is masked only by volatility.   Keep in mind, market makers might decide to shakeout the market before going higher. They want to get rid of any weak hands that would act as resistance during the bull run. By inducing an artificial dip they can test the remaining supply and absorb any remaining tokens from squeezed longs and panicking traders.  Don't fall for that. If price crashes from here, it is an agenda to get you to sell before the rally. If you are in right now, consider yourself fortunate. You are holding a ticket to a massive bull run that should outperform Bitcoin over the next year. Ensure you cannot be margin squeezed. Put in some limit buy orders (below 20ct) to turn the tables on market makers by snapping up THEIR tokens for cheap rather than the other way around. If you are cautious you can also wait for the retest above 45ct to confirm the run at the cost of missing out on 40% of gains.  Either way, the only wrong thing you can do right now is selling.

5058,0,"Bitcoin does not scale, and this is why those that are attempting to rule the world like it so much and thus the high 20k price. Because it does not scale, these people can extend it to support scaling. However, these people own all the datacenters that provide the scaling, and this is why they want to make Bitcoin the ""official"" world electronic currency. These people are attempting to abolish all other forms of cash like paper. Bitcoin will then be worked into the central banking system, and effectively will be created out of thin air by these people simply by raising the price of Bitcoin higher and higher and higher, and these people will already own almost all the Bitcoin. Everyone else will only have .000000001 and then only .00000000000001 bitcoin. As you can see this is effectively the same as creating currency out of thin air for themselves as they already do now. These people will also be charging as high a fee as they want for people to even use bitcoin. Bitcoin is clearly a scam. The price will definitely rise to 200k per coin.  IOTA should give itself more marketing as a common payment that is better than Bitcoin with no fees, in addition to the marketing as the payment layer of the internet of things. There are many more uses for IOTA as a support protocol for anything related to independent secure decentralized peer to peer transactions.  The reason why Bitcoin is 20k and IOTA is .30 is because Bitcoin is a scam and IOTA may not be, and the people that are attempting to rule the world have an evil plan for Bitcoin.

5059,0,"I bought IOTA at ATH in 2017. Then at 2$ then at 1$ like an absolute potato.  For 3 years I have been holding those IOTAs, and today I've realized the huge cost of opportunity.   If I had cut my losses at the beginning of 2020 and reinvested that money in my other investment (BTC and stock market) I would have recovered everything that I lost in IOTA and I would have been about +30% of my initial IOTA investment. And even would have retaken my original position in IOTA at a fraction of the price (around 90% discount).   I do believe that if played right IOTA can be the currency of the future of the machine economy. But my timing could not have been worse. There are HUGE opportunities out there in terms of investment that are performing way better than IOTA.   If you have a considerable cash flow (I don't) then this investment could remain there while you invest in something else.  But if you are holding this bag since 2017 and you don't have a big cashflow so you should care about this investment and the money you are losing by not investing in something else (cost of opportunity).  That is why I am cutting my losses and moving on. If played right I can recover this investment in months instead of years.",Cutting my loses

5089,0,"It was meant to be July initially. Now it's February. Still no testnet in place either. After years of talk and backtracking, you really do begin to lose belief and trust in any of the claims made when it comes to development. Given the experiences so far I find it scarcely believable that 'coordicide' will be completed next year. To me, even mid to late-2022 is probably pushing it, given the obvious scale of the challenge. It would be nice to have a bit more realism going forward....and definitely more transparency.   Prior to the change of approach this year, all previous work and focus was essentially a waste of time. Hopefully, the solutions being worked on now won't be subject to more U-turns and it's the 'real deal' this time. I remain cynical on almost everything relating to IOTA currently but I do think the tangle itself will be well used in the future, adoption wise.   What isn't clear is whether the token has any genuine commercial use. Coloured coins detract from the initial vision and mean any token usage is likely to be fairly insignificant. Worst case scenario, tokenholders might ultimately end up being just mugs that propped up the MIOTA price for the IF to sell into to fund wages and R&amp;D, where ultimately the token shows no price growth in the medium or even long-term; instead being a mere vessel for coloured coin conversions.",Will Chrysalis be delayed again in the new year?

5104,0,,"IOTA Releases Alpha Version of New Wallet, Firefly, With Improved Security"
5105,0,"Few weeks ago I was writting about the bull momentum of Iota. I was speaking about reaching the target price of 45 cents, and then I said something else. I said and then after that we are probably off to 1 dolar mark. If I have to guess , probably to 1.2 before another pullback. Well, the first part of my prediction was pretty much spot on. We reached 43 cents, in some markets we did get to 45. So Ill take that as a good prediction. After it, we had a big pullback.   Now, why did it happen and why was it that big? Other than the obvious that btc crashed everything with it, the other factor was  it happened becouse we are still using the same thinking that we did for 3 years now living in a bear environment. People are still in  that mentality of small gains and big price depreciation. But the market sentiment  has turned. The bulls are starting to win again. 2 things that would need to happen, and I believe they are very likely to happen pretty soon to reverse that psychology: The btc would have to cross 20k mark, and Iota would have to cross the 45 cents mark. After that mark, the true bull market will start.   So currently we are sitting on 33 cents. The btc is currently trapped with a big sell wall to 20k mark, so hes probably not going anywhere any time soon. The defi craze is making some gains. So its getting likely that while btc is sitting, alts will start to gain some momentum, iota included. Now, looking at it from logical standpoint, this prices are still very good entry points considering what our potential is if the bull market comes to fruition. This is a bit controversial now, but I believe anything under 1,5 - 2$ per miota is a good entry considering what a true targets could get in 2021 or 2022. Few bullish points I have to make before i stop moonboying :)  :  \- even without the coordicide and other big developments coming our way, the Iota price will increase based solely on the potential of other big exchanges start listing it in their ranks based solely on speculation alone  \- even without adoption, the price will increase based solely on coming protocol improvements speculation alone  \-I believe all 3 things are coming our way; we'll get more exchanges, more imrovements to the protocol and a true adoption will happen maybe as early as the standardization proccess gets completed.  So exciting times ahead, cheers to all &lt;3",Bear mentality in a bull market
5107,0,"Once we look at IOTA under enough scrutiny, very quickly we stumble upon two realities that are seemingly unreconcilable: it's the project with the most upside within the entire crypto space, the only one with a truly industry-first approach (the only approach to adoption that makes sense in my opinion)... yet price action is literally the worst out of any crypto within the top 100.  This made sense up until a certain point for me: lack of valuation models make the market cap and price of cryptos impossible to estimate, uncertainty within the bear market of 20-18-2020, missing deliverables, etc... but now that a bull market is being established, are Telcos and other partners simply blind, or do they simply don't think the token will have actual value? At current price, scooping up a significant portion of the market (something like 5-10%) is still doable over time and wouldn't that constitute an epic opportunity for a huge, mature company? It's a ridiculously easy feat to accomplish if you're BOSCH or Orange with billions in cash, and owning a sizeable portion of the ""backbone of IOT"" seems like it's too way much potential power to pass up.  Yet we crash with bad news and crash with good news, so perhaps I'm vastly overestimating the project and the IF. It's clear that the giants who are working side by side with the IF on IOTA and related products/services have tons of BI and finance resources to spot a good deal like this and it's also clear that they're not investing considering volume and price. This points me towards the odds of the project succeeding actually being abysmally lower than the average investor expects, as even a 1000x upside is very average in the face of a 0.1% success rate.  It just seems insane to think about the trillions of dollars who are aware *and developing for/with IOTA*, see the current state of the market and decide to stay on the sidelines. At the same time, people have done much dumber things at every point of human history, so I'm not sure what to think.","Either Telcos and other corporations are getting cold feet because of the legal ramifications of both developing on and holding IOTA (and/or other crypto), or the token is going nowhere."

I remember the contentious bitcoin fork because they couldn't settle on a scaling mechanism. I remember 20$ transaction fees. I remember 5$ gas fees on the ethereal network. I know ETH 2.0 is ""around the corner"" (Truth is they're facing many of the same delays Iota is), but is still going to have fees. Crypto is going to have a crazy bullpen coming up. but until those pain points start being hit again, then Iota won't be there shining. Iota doesn't even have much of a problem to solve right now. People seem pretty satisfied with Bitcoin and Ethereum and crypto has settled into its niche. Defi started popping off, and Uniswap has 10$ gas fees so the trades happen more quickly. Yet, it's one of the most popular exchanges there is.      What Iota is trying to do is the blue ocean strategy. They plan on creating entirely new business models. They aren't competing with Bitcoin, or Ethereum, or gold. They are competing with VISA. They are competing with USD. If they can solve the ""fees"" problem, then Iota will be what everybody thought bitcoin was going to be. Now maybe this won't happen. Maybe the technology doesn't work.

They troughed about three years later, just before the second Gulf War in early 2003.  Each stock had its individual path to hell, but really, the price of just about every tech stock was dictated by overall market conditions.    Right now we're probably in the equivalent of late 2002.  Negativity is rampant, and of course IOTA is apparently beset by delays.  If there weren't delays the price would still be rock bottom.  So really, the details don't matter.    Back in 2002, if you said anything positive about any tech stock you'd get shot down.

The whole alt market has started to wake up after a long and cold sleep. The market showed that it is ready to show the alts some love too. Even though btc was outperforming the alt market in general sense, there were some shiny examples of better performing alts out there..  So the price of iota is starting to show some life again. Its been a while. The bull market is becoming more and more apparent by each coming day.  The last real resistance iota has before it starts to gain some momentum is 30 cents and the bulls are starting to pile up. I was there all the way back in 2016. And yea , in my opinion history is stsrting to repeat itself again.. and for iota it is a pretty bright future, especially tge 2021. But I suspect we could get some momentum starting even vefore of that. This could very well be last moments at this low prices.. Last real test is in our noses, sitting few cents away from this price, after that we are cery shortly off to 45 cents an then probably 1$. If coordicide and the other stuff kicks in time, we could reach ath maybe even as early as next year. The potential is big , the volume is still quite low. It doesnt eve take serious money to get the ball rolling at this point. Probably something of tge order of few mili $ from some whale woul md present a tremendous buying pressure thst would make the price start kicking.. for example the bosch or jaguar are companies that number their evslustion in billions so its pretty easy to imagine how little it takes, although the best possible future would be the moment when the price starts appreciating based on increasing real world use cases.

The biggest risk we had in my opinion in 2017-18 was the possibility of regular blockchain solving the trilema somehow, something that still remains so far away no one can really say which year it might happen.  According to Gartner, IoT (as the beginning of a fully fleshed out industry) was estimated to be 2-5 years away as of 2017. We are about to witness an eclosion.

Why? I think we have to consider how corporate behemoths and larger partners would plan their purchasing of an asset such as IOTA.  For starters - This is a purely hypothetical example, but why couldn‚Äôt a tech / engineering giant, such as Bosch, easily buy 3-5 TIOTA and write up about $1 Mil as miscellaneous R&amp;D expenses over the course of 1-2 years? When your annual profits are just shy of $5 Bil and you‚Äôre constantly searching out innovative investments, 1 Mil is a pittance.. a mere drop in the bucket. In fact, corporations and large investors can get their hands on a full 1% of the total IOTA supply for just $5-10 Mil at today‚Äôs prices (all depending on fluctuations).  Realize that these entities would most likely use a staggered buying approach and span out accumulations across monthly - perhaps quarterly - periods for internal budgetary reasons, to avoid triggering a mania, and also possibly to keep their activities concealed from any competitors. In other words, you and I won‚Äôt *know* that they‚Äôre gradually stacking IOTA... and that‚Äôs exactly how they want it (for now).  What if several companies and large partners do this over the course of 2020 - 2022? Perhaps some have even started well before 2020. Eventually, something will ignite the spark - possibly a domino effect of corporate announcements and gobs of speculative news-bites *and/or* the big open-market players and exchanges (Binance, Bitfinex, et al) reconciling a dwindling supply and surging demand. That sudden realization that ‚ÄúOh! Some very smart and important people are after this!‚Äù could jumpstart some frenzied buying. And while I‚Äôm not suggesting Dec 2017 is ‚Äúdestined‚Äù to repeat itself... are you at least starting to see how it‚Äôs possible?  It‚Äôs just a theory at this point, and it relies upon several assumptions - perhaps the largest being that Coordicide is successful. However, I do think gradual, long-term buyers and holders need to consider this possibility, as it just further emphasizes the benefits of stretching out your buys and not fixating on some random, low entry-point. I still keep seeing posts and comments everywhere from people about ‚Äúwaiting to get in‚Äù or ‚Äúplanning to load up at $0.15‚Äù ..or ‚Äú$0.10‚Äù because DeFi, COVID, etc. have them on edge.

Coronavirus has accelerated adoption of this technology.   Let‚Äôs ignore things like whether coordicide/sharding/mana fails. Let‚Äôs ignore things like whether the IF is directly working with central banks to make it happen.   What we do need to understand are a few things.  1) What are their needs? Of course they need security, they need costs to be low, they‚Äôd probably prefer a system where central banks can interact seamlessly, but above all else they need enormous scaling for a project like this. They also do not have time on their side.  2) Will the central banks of the world build their own solution? Almost decidedly not. As christine has told us, if a central bank hands down a currency solution, the people will trust it. Anything that happens after release to jeopardize trust in their solution will destroy everything. But we already know how hard it is to build a distributed payment system and how long it takes to build from scratch. Does the central banks have the resources to do it right and quickly? Probably. But would they be talking about doing this now if that was their plan? Coronavirus was not planable, the central banks need such a system and they cannot afford to wait. A second wave and lockdown is highly likely at least in the US, which will no doubt accelerate this trend even more.    So. What are they going to do? We know they have contact with the IF through various routes (political socials, various EU programs, etc). We know they are standardizing, we know iota has the characteristics and the appeal/narrative they need to foster trust.   So, i‚Äôm going to call it. Iota will be the system on which all central banks deploy their CBDC solutions. Either in whole or in part, iota will be the catalyst that makes it possible.   Just an honest prediction. :) I don‚Äôt care if it comes true or not but the signs seem blaring enough to post about.

5319,0,"IOTA is a Dream  Iota has an interesting and clever approach to solve a problem that still doesn't exist. But I think that's the burden of not just being surfing a trend of a major play in the space. I think it will actually create or at least provide the means for the next social revolution. I think the reason Iota doesn't moon just right now is the lack of a defi protocol linked with it. I think it simply doesn't worth to hold Iota yet. I myself have been a holder since early 2017, but now I've just allocated more than half of what I have to the defi world as I plan to buy the same amount when Iota be ready to be staked. I know I should have done this before but it was my first experience in the finance world and was unexperienced and hold only iota. However I feel the crypto world is just one, cuz most of the coins are easily interchangeable. It is gonna be like metals I think, or traditional Fiat currency from different nations, although with an easier interchangeability and a broader use like day to day currency as well as an storage means. Two in one, overtaking gold for sure. I think bitcoin is too far from being knocked down by another crypto maybe just becouse of its fame, just like gold (since there are more valuable metals) as it is useless to most people for their normal lives. But that won't stop other crypto to see 10000x gains if they prove to be useful or at least cool to hold (I think that will be the only one reason to hold bitcoin one day). I think Iota has the greatest potential of all coins simply because it is going to work on a day to day needed machines transactions and it works flaweslly and it is feeless. I think it's the best way to generate decentralized wealth among people. It's simply the best for human race, and I believed that it may take some time but, we always tend to go towards the best for us. Just compare the middle age and today. We are decentralizing the power a little bit every time, as today we have presidents instead of kings, nor it is less likely to someone become wealthy by itself. My decision was made only to in the future I can be able to afford even more miotas, but if it rockets any time sooner I'll be glad the same way as the world will be a place where the distance between the wealthy and common people will be a much smaller, with almost everyone been able to enjoy a wealthy life with not so much effort as it is needed today. I think Iota is gonna be like the protocol that the machines will be using to work in our places, it's gonna be amazing. It could take like 20 years or maybe less, but I think who is strong hand enough to bear this long is gonna be able to afford things that are unimaginable today...

5359,0,"Volatility and unexpected price movement is quite common in the crypto industry, but Binance.us (not to be confused with ‚Äú*.com*‚Äù) takes this to an entirely different level with IOTA.  Take the recent price surge of Aug 10, 2020 for example. We witnessed a rise of MIOTA from about $0.35 to just under **$0.42** on many exchanges. This was followed by a return to the mid-to-high $0.30‚Äôs less than 12 hours later. However, during this same timeframe, Binance.us prices blew into ***$0.50‚Äôs*** territory, and hovered in the $0.40‚Äôs for well over 24 hours.  Putting that into perspective if you‚Äôre interested in trading IOTA - you could have achieved a **20%** gain in 24 hours with most exchanges if you bought right before the surge and sold at the top. But with Binance.us, you had an opportunity for a ***45-55%*** gain in that same 24 hours. That difference is pretty significant!  I‚Äôve noticed these extreme variances in volatility have occurred in other situations throughout the past year. How is this explained? I suspect it‚Äôs a consequence of adding up the following:  1. Binance.us is intended only for U.S. investors, which is a small subset of an exceptionally large global market. Less buyers and sellers implies less liquidity, and this would be expected to widen the ranges that market participants are willing to purchase or part with their assets (especially during surges and panics).  2. Fortunately for Binance.us (but not others), there currently aren‚Äôt many options available for U.S.-based investors to exchange IOTA. In fact, I suspect most users consider this their *only* option at the moment and are more likely to accept prices that are wildly different from the market averages. Many of them may not even be taking average market prices into consideration *at all* when deciding to buy or sell IOTA, effectively isolating Binance.us as the ""one true"" representation of supply and demand (as far as U.S. investors are concerned).  3. IOTA deposits and withdrawals are constantly being suspended on Binance.us for long periods of time, and the reason isn‚Äôt entirely clear. This may discourage diversified U.S. crypto investors and traders from transacting IOTA through this platform, thus even *further* reducing the number of potential buyers and sellers (which circles back to #1 above).  I‚Äôm curious about others‚Äô impressions and theories, as I‚Äôve found the phenomena that is ‚ÄúBinance.us‚Äù to be both frustrating and amusing at times. I'm searching for a better understanding of *why* these wild price fluctuations are happening, and how they may be impacting U.S. investors in general, as well as the larger market.  Also, feel free to share if you have any crazy trading experiences with Binance.us - especially if you‚Äôve noticed any interesting patterns that may further explain the often stupefying volatility.",Binance.us - The Wild Roller Coaster of IOTA Trades

5401,0,"In 2017, we saw the largest (in absolute terms, not in exponential growth terms) bubble in the history of crypto. During that bubble, IOTA hit between ~$5.40 and $6.00 depending on the exchange, then went down. During the run between $1.00 and its peak, the main subreddit grew from ~10,000 to ~100,000 users.   Somehow this number has only grown, most likely because a ton of people are 'dormant' in that they believed in IOTA but got way too hyped, probably assuming production-ready solutions in 6 months to a year. A lot of them have possibly sold and a lot probably held too but as far as I know the vast majority of them believe that if IOTA achieves its goals, it will make us all a lot of money.  Well, so far the IF is slowly getting closer to achieving them. I think if Coordicide is successful, we'll see even more industrial support and it makes me giddy because as far as I've seen, IOTA is really the only cryptocurrency with: 1) an actual shot at solving the DLT 'trilemma' of scalability, security and decentralization, 2) a viable path to adoption by targeting industrial corporations that can actual build and benefit from the system directly.

5413,0,"Apologies if this isn't the right sub to post this, but I'm not sure where else to do so. Tried posting in r/iota but it got removed.  A week ago I made an exchange on changelly, liquidating one crypto for iota. Long story short, the exchange took forever before failing to send funds, changelly says the exchange was made, but the hash was invalid and so my iota funds were never sent to my wallet. They haven't been very helpful, just saying it should be resolved ""soon."" It's been a week. They last corresponded, saying it was on the exchange market and their technical department is working on the situation, with no guess on when it will be resolved and no further details.  So my question is, is there anyone I should reach out to from iota, since the hash was invalid/corrupt (not sure what the right term is, but the blockchain link on my transaction ID only says ""something went wrong while loading data"")? Or am I just at the whim of the tech gods on this one?",Exchange issue

5430,0,"There is an argument that ranking doesn't matter, but as a coin goes down the ranks, its profile diminishes.  MIOTA has been incrementally losing rank since the end of 2017, and it seems that the main reason is that it doesn't have the magic pump card that other coins have, to increase or maintain ranking.  MIOTA would never go up 50-100% in  few days, like other coins do.  While pumps get largely dumped, a bit of it sticks.  MIOTA just doesn't have mega rises - it got those out of its system in early December 2017.  Under these circumstances, I can see the coin dropping out of the top 30 over the next month, as other coins pump past it, which will give it the impression that it is just another also-ran. Will MIOTA have a high rank than Dogecoin by by September?  I am not sure.",I hope ranking doesn't matter

IOTA don't have incentive for proof-of-work (miners), neither for proof-of-stake and big players jumps to most profitable coins or deposit their big bucks to get the best rewards. Besides speculation I don't see how price can grow while coordicide isn't done and working.

Am I missing something?",Why IOTA price should rise before coordicide?

5586,0,"The IOTA/Tangle community seems to be the least focused on tokenization. Here's why that's wrong:  IOTA may be feeless, but it's not free to use. Users are paying in:  1. IOTA Volatility (regularly &gt;1% daily)  2. Exchange fees - moving in/out of IOTA to avoid volatility (0.25 - 1%)  Transaction fees, volatility or exchange fees. Value is lost, it doesn't matter how.  ""but IOTA will stabilize as it grows""   Yes it will, but too slowly for it to matter.  Bitcoin isn't stable now at $100 billion, nor was it stable at $300 billion. IOTA won't be either. (IOTA would grow 250-750x in value to reach those market caps. Of course there will be enormous volatility on the way up)  Maybe they will be stable enough to use as a medium of exchange (MoE) if they ever reach $trillions.  __________  What the Tangle needs most is a stablecoin. Picture this combination:  - Ethereum tokens (ERC20/721) - programmable, standardized, plug and play.  - Colored coins - every token unit is created 'from' IOTA  Ethereum DAI is supposed to be divisible to 18 decimal places - but gas fees stop you at 2 ($0.01)  Tangle DAI (TAI) could be truly divisible, with each unit created from 1i:  $1 to $0.01 = 100i ($1 million = 100Mi)  $1 to $0.0001 = 10Ki ($1 million = 10Gi)  etc  This allows for stable micropayments, 100 - 10,000x smaller than what is currently possible.  Important points:  - TAI would remove the need to ever 'exit' the Tangleconomy.  - TAI could be pegged to any single/basket of assets, not just fiat.  - TAI Stabilization &gt; DAI's, because of feeless/granular arbitrage. (peg could be $0.99999X, instead of $0.999X)  - TAI could have different levels of divisibility ($0.01, $0.0001, etc)  - TAI drives IOTA value, making the latter more desirable as a MoE as they both grow.  - TAI would accelerate the growth of the Tangle - look at everything that has grown around DAI on Ethereum.  - TAI &gt; IOTA for large/normal/micro payments. (volatility is a nonstarter)  - IOTA &gt; TAI for nano payments ($0.00001&gt;), unless supply is drastically increased.  This has a couple of effects:  1. Short/medium term, it removes most of the need for IOTA as an MoE.  2. IOTA supply will need to be carefully considered/eventually increased. (At $0.10Mi - 1i costs $0.0000001. At $100Mi - 1i costs $0.0001)  3. Long term, if IOTA grows from billions to trillions, it could become THE medium of exchange.  Thoughts?",The Tangle badly needs a Stablecoin

5601,0,"I personally view the switches from the IF away from trinary, qubic, jinn and quantum resistant signatures as very promising. They realized that those 4 goals were too ambitious at this point in time and have decided to focus their efforts on shorter term goals that will lead to quicker adoption. Many people in this space would prefer the foundation to stick with previous goals for the sake of remaining consistent, but this is not logical. The IF should always move in the direction of what's best for the industry and not what makes the project look unchanging. If science was unchanging we would still believe the earth is flat. The IF was not on track for adoption dumping resources into these projects, but due to the recent pivot they are now on track for major adoption. I'm very proud of the foundation's willingness to embrace change for the sake of industry adoption. Also keep in mind that qubic, trinary, jinn and quantum computing will be a part of our future, just not in the short term. In the meantime, contribute something meaningful to the project if you're able. If not, just wait for the future to unfold",My takeaway from the recent iota events

5666,0,"I will be honest with you. IOTA is the project I put all of my hopes in since mid 2017 and also the one I‚Äôm invested in the most. But I definitely lost a lot of faith in IOTA over the last years. My intention for this post is not to spread FUD. I‚Äôd really like to discuss some topics that seem very odd and I‚Äôd appreciate your input. If I got things wrong please feel free to correct me. I will try to add some sources but most of these things are well known within the community. If you need information more you can join the official discord and read back past announcements or use the search function to find certain discussions.  We all know that IOTA promised a lot over the past years but there are very few things that actually happened. A lot of things that made IOTA special and a lot of things that were promoted along the way simply will not happen or will be removed in the future. Many of these things have already or will impact the price. Here are my comments towards...  &amp;#x200B;  **1. The coordinator just directs the flow of the tangle**  I guess everyone knows by now. IOTA is centralized. Value transactions have been disabled for almost a month now. Nobody can move their funds because the coordinator is down. Next topic.  &amp;#x200B;  **2. IOTA can scale**  In the past, IOTA was always promoted as a cryptocurrency that could scale. One transaction has to confirm two others. Spam helps the network. Spam the network to help make it faster. The coordinator will be shut down as soon as the network reaches a certain number of transactions per second.  Today we know that all of this is not true. IOTA 1.0 (the current IOTA) cannot scale. Spamming only forces the nodes to make snapshots more often because they run out of space. Too much spam kills the network. IOTA 1.0 doesn‚Äôt work. We need a totally new approach. Even the ‚Äúone transaction has to confirm two others‚Äù rule might not stay. \[[1](https://imgur.com/a/Ch4U43j)\]  &amp;#x200B;  **3. JINN**  In the past the Founders always said that IOTA was developed for JINN. A Trinary Processor developed by a company owned by Sergey Ivancheglo (CFB) and David Sonstebo. That‚Äôs why IOTA is Trinary. \[[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwhJQ67zxbg&amp;t=2050s)\] Now after years of research and development we get huge news: JINN is dead. \[[3](https://imgur.com/a/4NZHHvE)\]  Also, CFB leaves IOTA and threatens to sue David Sonstebo. David and CFB engage in an open twitter and discord war. CFB wants to work on his own Trinary version of IOTA \[[4](https://twitter.com/PeterInAsia1/status/1236639107905798145?s=20)\]  &amp;#x200B;  **4. Trinary**  IOTA will switch to Binary after wasting years with programming everything with Trinary hardware in mind. \[[5](https://iota.cafe/t/binary-transaction-layout/324)\] \[[6](https://blog.iota.org/chrysalis-b9906ec9d2de)\]  &amp;#x200B;  **5. The Trinary hash function Troika** \[[7](https://blog.iota.org/iota-and-cybercrypt-announce-new-lightweight-trinary-cryptographic-hash-function-678e741315e8)\]  IOTA and CYBERCRYPT developed a new Trinary hash function for IOTA. With the switch to Binary this hash function is now useless and all the time and resources spent on it were wasted.  &amp;#x200B;  **6. Signature Scheme**  IOTA uses Winternitz One Time Signatures (WOTS) to make it quantum secure. This is the reason why it‚Äôs not safe to send from an address twice. Ok, just don‚Äôt reuse addresses, what‚Äôs the problem? The problem is that everything that is build for IOTA from wallets to exchange integrations is way more complicated to program and maintain than any other crypto. If I was an exchange I‚Äôd never ever list IOTA. Additionally, people that are only familiar with other cryptos might reuse an address and put their funds at risk. And this happens a lot. And for what? There are no quantum computers. Now after years it seems the IOTA Foundation finally realized that WOTS suck for adoption and want to add another signature scheme which allows address reuse and is not quantum secure. So much time wasted. \[[6](https://blog.iota.org/chrysalis-b9906ec9d2de)\]  &amp;#x200B;  **7. Switch from a balance model to UTXO model** \[[6](https://blog.iota.org/chrysalis-b9906ec9d2de)\] \[[7](https://iota.cafe/t/switching-to-utxo-model-for-balances-colored-coins-easier-conflict-resolution/229)\]  UTXO will be so much better and easier than our current model. Much innovation. But Bitcoin and other cryptos have been using the UTXO model from the beginning.  &amp;#x200B;  **8. People leaving the IOTA Foundation**  A lot of great people left the IOTA Foundation and for most we don‚Äôt know why. To my knowledge there is no public list of people who still work for the IF. Here are some people who left (most silently):  Samuel Reid, Rolf Werner, Ralf Rottmann, David Cohen, Jesse Babbra, Andreas Osowksi, John D. Licciardello, Gur Huberman, Alisa Maas, Janine Hartel, Lukas Tassanyi (MicroHash)  And these are just a few I found after a quick search in Discord.  &amp;#x200B;  **9. Qubic (Q)**  There was a huge hype around Q even before it was announced. There was a new website including a countdown. Until today we actually didn‚Äôt see anything significant related to Q except some posts by Eric Hop indicating that qubic is still very far away.  &amp;#x200B;  **10. IOTA 2.0 (Coordicide)**  The developers spent (wasted) years fixing IOTA 1.0 until they finally realized that it doesn‚Äôt work (it‚Äôs centralized and not scalable) although they told us it was simulated and well researched before. The IOTA Foundation repeatedly publicly attacked researchers who found flaws in the protocol.  IOTA 2.0 is basically a totally different protocol than the current one. The prototype is not finished yet. It‚Äôs not tested at all and it gets rid of most things that were used in the current version. How high is the chance that IOTA 2.0 will work? It seems like over the past years a lot of time was simply wasted on developing things that got tossed into the bin and now they are starting all over.  &amp;#x200B;  **11. Partnerships and Adoption**  If IOTA has one thing it‚Äôs partnerships. But after an announced partnership nothing ever really followed. So, is any company like Bosch, VW, Nokia, Audi, Vodafone or Jaguar actually still working on building something with IOTA or did they drop it?  &amp;#x200B;  **12. Wallet hack**  The recent wallet hack could have been avoided easily but the Moonpay integrating was rushed and nobody checked the code again.  An unknown amount of seeds has been stolen and the attacker will be able to transfer the funds of everyone who didn‚Äôt use the migration tool in time to exchanges and dump everything on March 10 along with anyone who wanted to sell within the last month.   &amp;#x200B;  **All these points made me lose a lot of faith in my investment long term but especially short term. I talked to some friends and especially the ones following the project very closely share my doubts.**  **But my sample number is rather small so I‚Äòd appreciate your input. Please feel free to comment on anything I wrote and feel free to disagree or correct me.**",Let's talk about IOTA (serious)

5691,0,"IOTA is making great progress lately. The Trinity hack of this month is sad, but just a temporary blocker. Within a month we have forgotten this incident and we can prepare for a great bull run.  - IOTA listened to critics and can will finally deliver. A good example is the short-term switch to binary, and switch to UTXO. - CFB seemed to have blocked several progress over the last years, this is now solved. - Part of the Chrysalis update will be rolled out this year which will bring significant improvements to the mainnet. - Qubic is finally coming to a point where community can start testing. Also Qubic will benefit from the crysalis updates. - Meanwhile GoShimmer/Bee team continues building the coordinatorless network of which the first testnets are to be expected this year. - Coordicide itself will probably happen next year.

5761,0, I bought IOTA at more than 3 dollars years ago and now the price is around 30 Cents. Is this all hype even now? I put in my life savings in.  Ultimately it is the finance behind the idea that matters. IOTA was around 9th place when I bought. Today it is in 18th place. Why is no one pushing IOTA to get the market fundamentals right so that there will be a good valuation instead of still doing the hype. What is going on?  I mean why are 17 companies ahead of IOTA. Why is not IOTA not in 2nd place?  I am getting tired of the nonsense about all this technical stuff. No one cares about technical stuff if it does not have market adoption. VHS beat out Sony though Sony had a better product. Ultimately it is how well the product is accepted by the market that matters and how much the valuation improved that matters.

How is this any different then the 2017 ICO premine team allocation token bad practices?   I mean just think about it.

The professionalism, the top-notch team consisting of some of the most renowed scientific researches and the innovation the IOTA protocol itself brings just astonishes me. I haven't found any other project in cryptospace yet that can be compared to IOTA.  When coordicide succeeds (and I say when instead of if as imo - following the latest IOTA news it is just a matter of time) and when QUBIC is implemented IOTA will be decentralized, scalebale and one of the most scaleable solutions out there. and instead of adding layer 2 solutions liker the other existing protocols try to do in order to improve efficiency the IOTA team aims at providing a solid core solution for layer 1 which has not been dared by any other crypto project yet. Combine this with the numerous possibilities of QUBIC (e.g. for smart contracts) it inevitable that IOTA will by far outgrow Etherum. I know that Etherum holds the larger user base / projects building on it at the moment but when it comes to technology and adoption, companies and current technology will require and thus shift to the most optimized backbone which in my opinion will be IOTA.   However I am wondering about why this project doesn't get the recognition it deserves out there? On the contrary I see a lot of bashing and mocking of the IOTA project / protocol / team and for some it seems that the whole thing is just a meme due to a team that supposedly does announcements but does not deliver. How can these people not have seen what has been accomplished in 2019? How can they have missed the roadmap they presented for 2020 and beyond? How can the consequences of a successful Coordicide and QUBIC implementation be missed? Or is it just me who's too hyped over the technology and innovation the IOTA project holds for the future when in fact it does not bring more innovation than any other existing project out there?",Valuation of the IOTA project / token

It has gone up 20 times in a very short period of time. 2. It is only listed on exchanges I have never heard of. 3. Its volume is similar to IOTA's.  This would suggest that having listings on mainstream exchanges is not necessarily important.  Indeed, if there is concentrated news/hype, low listings and low volumes can actually be an advantage.  It also demonstrates what can happen if the news is good enough.  Of course IOTA starts from a much higher level than MINDOL did.  We can't go up 20 times in a couple of months while the crypos are so highly correlated.  But looking forward to 2021 or 2022, when perhaps no-one is thinking of crypto, MINDOL demonstrates how quickly we could go from say 5c/10c/15c the $1/$2/$3.",Observations about MINDOL
5885,0,"So, summarized the last 2 years have been really bad for the token price, the last 10 days were nearly a stab with a dagger.     What do you see as factors for the price movement in the next few days?     1) In my poinion the most importaint cause for the recent drop was the summit in Berlin, with big expectations: The roadmap has not been presented. Everyone was waiting for it. Nobody said the roadmap will be presented at this time, but a lot of people have been expecting it.   1)a) What could the roadmap look like? Wen Coordicide? Is this the only point everyone is waiting for? Yes and No! We should know that Dom Schiener said in an interview with the blocktrainer that if there is not at least 80% chance that coordicide will be finished in 2020, we can all go home. So that implies that we see a coordicide in 2020 with an 80% chance. I'm afraid everyone expects it right now (since the statement of Mr. Popov ""We did it""). It is inevitable that this wont happen right now. So what are the expectations of the investors who didnt sell until now?   1)b) What effect will the roadmap have to the token price? What could be written down that the price will go up? I personally have no glue.     2) How much will be the effect of the hornet development? They are an a good was, had a few bugfixes in beta stadium. Nodes will be able to perform more tps with lower cpu effort. Hopefully that will be released within a few weeks to mainnet.   &amp;#x200B;  3) BTC Price:   3)a) Longs (on Bitfinex) are pretty high, Shorts are increasing in the last 24h. The last time that happened, BTC dropped really hard - but this time there is no hardfork in sight, right now. Traders expect a hard squeeze in any direction. This is a very tight situation.  3)a) But nevertheless, the last months showed us that the IOTA price goes down with a BTC dump, but dont go up with a pump. Its time to change the momentum.     4) I'm not a trader, so pls excuse my following language. IOTA trades are on a very low volume. On the 3h Heikin Ashi MACD is floating around zero with the averages in the negative area. With the low RSI and the rising MFI, we can expect a shift. Maybe. But who cares about TA? Especially when there are the factors 1,2 and 3 like written above?  &amp;#x200B;  5) The IF, in recent times, always was talking about the protocol, not the token. People might think that there is no use of the token, the protocol has the most importance to the IF.   Of course, this is right. When the protocol becomes a standard, and is super scalable and decentralised, Linux Edge is working and production chains or trash systems can be ran on the protocol, with all the pros that a decentralised database protocol can deliver - then, the token price must follow. The Token price is the master plan for the mid future.    What do you see as factors for the price movement in the next few days?",Pro and Con for buying IOTA after the massive price drop
5886,0,"This is a bit of a weird one.   So I‚Äôve been reading the book ShoeDog Millionaire by Phil Knight. It‚Äôs basically the memoirs of the guy who founded and built Nike in the 70‚Äôs and built it to what it is today, likely a billion dollar company and one of the biggest brands in the world.   With Nike you would imagine it was some rich dude who invested loads of money and then got a hell of a lot richer, obviously the odd challenge but it just grew and grew in a linear fashion...wrong.  There was 2-3 times where Nike was one decision or one external event away from going broke. He nearly quit and went back to his accountancy job quit a few times.   Spoilers if you want to read the book...  &gt;!spoiler Their only supplier terminated their contract mid way through a contract. He nearly ran out of cash several times. When he first issued shares to the public and friends no one bought any. The bank cut off his credit. Competitors try to take his ‚Äúturf‚Äù and sell their shoes. So many big challenges to overcome. !&lt;  Obviously there is an element of survivor bias and companies that went through similar challenges and failed we won‚Äôt hear about as they don‚Äôt exist anymore. But for me it goes to show that it‚Äôs not all going to be plain sailing, in fact it‚Äôs seems 80% of the time there‚Äôs some big seemingly unsurmountable hurdle to overcome. A daily fight and then little breather until the next big hurdle appears.   My big takeaway is... generally in building a business (which is what the IF are doing) things rarely go to plan, even with the based made plans. However, its about starting off down the road of that plan anyway and then pivoting when the hurdle pops up. This is what reassured me, as the IF always seem to be analysing and considering which is the best way forward.   It‚Äôs also interesting how grass roots they were and ‚Äúuncorporate‚Äù for the first 4-5 years, with a local community of athletes helping grow it. Nothing as you would imagine if you look at Nike today.",Reading Shoedog Millionaire has reassured me about IOTA and it‚Äôs progress

5933,0,Crypto is pretty broken as a market and an industry. Thousands of useless coins and lots of spurious claims/promises made.   Iota needs to be different....by delivering on it's statements and deadlines.,What happened to all major exchanges by EoY 2018?
5934,0,"TL;DR:  * This is my experience - not advice. DYOR and make your own decisions. * I made mistakes and got Goxxed * Waiting it out between ATHs makes everything that happens between irrelevant * In the current speculative market, coin price doesn't mirror projet health * The market is tethered to BTC  * IOTA is well positioned when the market transitions away from pure speculation * Take a deep breath and HODL   Just wanna give you guys some perspective from my point of view. This isn't advice, just sharing my perspective and approach. If you don't believe in this project, then maybe it's better to invest in something you believe in.  I bought BTC in 2013 - a few months before the ATH of the time, back then it hadn't gone over $1000. Just like that, before the end of the year, I more than tripled my money. Skip to a few months later, and it was all gone.  I was a fkn n00b and had no idea what I was doing. Name a mistake, I made it:  * **DYOR:** Nope. I had no idea about trading or crypto. * **Catch a falling knife:** Check. I lost a lot panic selling/buying back in. * **'Invested' in a scam:** Check. I stumbled across a site that allowed you to buy 'shares' of Bitcoin 'trading companies' that offered great returns. * **Buy Litecoin with Bitcoin:** Check. * **Hold your coins on an exchange:** Check. Mt Gox. I thought I was doing the right thing.. 2FA, Code generator, 30 character password. None of that helps when the exchange gets 'hacked'. * **Don't invest what you can't afford to lose:** Check. I maxxed out some credit lines. I got Goxxed. I moved back with my parents and paid them off. 3 years of my life feelin like crap.  Hindsight makes you the wisest man.. but only because you've made mistakes and have the benefit of time.  Bitcoin hit an ATH on on November 30 2013 - with $1154. The next ATH was on December 17 2017 - the price hit $20,089. That's a gap of **4 years 17 days** or **1478 days**.  If you bought in on November 30 2013, held, then cashed out any time between mid Dec 2017 and mid Jan 2018 -- NOTHING that happened in between matters.  It would be interesting to get a $ value on how many people looked at the price drifting down and sideways, (justifiably) got pessimistic, then decided to cut their losses. I imagine all the 'Bitcoin is dead' articles would have helped them make their exit. Imagine how they felt being nocoiners at the next ATH..  IOTA is a different beast. Understand that this is a **TECHNOLOGY** developed with physicists and mathematicians. This isn't just code that lets person A send value to person B. IOTA tests the upper limits of speed, encryption, and computation. The fabric of IOTA is the Tangle + Qubic. This will be the foundation for automated economies that don't exist yet..   Imagine owning an electricity broker bot connected to a smart city's electricity grid. The purpose of your bot is to trade electricity resources between machines. Your bot identifies a Lidbot with diminshing electricity reserves, puts out a tender for 2400 watts to all nearby solar panels connected to the industrial marketplace for that city. It receives 14 bids, it accepts the cheapest offer and onsells electricity to the Lidbot for a marginal profit, all within 3 seconds. Your bot performs 21,000 of these transactions per day, 24/7.  This kind of paradigm shift takes time and effort.. if you believe in the tech, be patient. We're in the incredibly slow period of transition, where prices are being driven by speculation, to being driven by adoption. IOTA's true worth is when there are billions of machines transacting simultaneously, with seamless real time exchange between IOTA and global fiat.  The token is important as it incentivises Quorum computing, and it's the unit of value for the impending M2M economy. But it's important to really digest that the currency isn't the drawcard. **And it's REALLY important to digest that the currency price is in no way correlated to the project's health.** The price of everything is tethered to BTC.  2017 was crypto's dot com bubble. Personally, I don't think we'll see another one as strong. Rather, I think growth will come steady and slow, and as the result of legitimate real world application. More than happy to be wrong on this.   IOTA hit its ATH on December 20 2017.  Take a deep breath, HODL.   btw: 1478 days from now is January 6 2022.",Take a deep breathe and HODL

The price back then was roughly $4 per mIOTA, which meant my first holding was around 40 mIOTA.  Since then every price drop has put a smile on my face, and i have consistently added to my holding with each drop. $150 each time.  Next $150 was at $3, then at $1.5 then at 0.3.  My holding is now well over 1 gIOTA (something i could have never afforded back in 2017) and with my next buy-in i will surpass 2 gIOTA with an average price well below $0.4.  I know it's a small investment compared to many and i realize that there's a really fair chance that this is just dead money.  But i also know that nobody has any clue about how the world looks in 5-10 years and that IF the IOTA Foundation succeeds in everything they have set out to do, the sky is the limit.

5975,0,"**// Repost here as it was** [auto-removed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/dtx5xx/recap_of_the_2018_board_discussion_leak/) **from** /r/iota **for ""price-related discussions"". I'm waiting for a manual approval but choose to post it here in the meantime.**  &amp;#x200B;  Hi guys.  In light of recent events, I revisited the old board discussion leak from 8th August 2018. You can find the whole transcript [here](https://pastebin.com/482HVvPu) if you would like to read it in full. After rereading it today, I thought it could be beneficial for everyone to put some parts of that discussion in relation to events that happened afterwards. I will try to stay as factual as possible and provide merely a timeline of events in relation to the transcript. In case I state wrong facts, please let me know so I can correct them. If you can provide more context, please let me know in the comments and provide a source.  The context of the leak was the discussion about letting CFB &amp; Popov join the Board of Directors. As the statue (at that time) allowed delegation of voting rights, there were fears involved regarding a potential power grab with the help of the two new votes. Therefore the plan was to change the statute of the foundation before nominating CFB and Popov to the board. CFB opposed the delay.  As I don't want to quote the full transcript here, I will only quote excerpts. I advise you to read it fully by yourself for full context. Lets dive in:  &gt;**Ralf Rottmann:**   &gt;   &gt;I highly recommend, that we ask Dentons to proactively do a conflict of interest assessment at least for CfB, as the pending Qubic IP Transfer (and the money involved) should be cleared upfront. We‚Äôve asked the same when I got nominated and grandcentrix is not remotely as involved as IOTA AS or Jinn Labs. Otherwise we always risk to lose our non-profit status. (Again some background: Should we ever lose our non-profit status, we‚Äôd have to pay taxes on everything up to ten years backwards. All board members, independent from citizenship, are personally liable, should IF not be able to pay those taxes in such an event.)  * Dentons probably refers to the lawfirm [Dentons](https://www.dentons.com/en). * IOTA AS is a [company registered by David in 2015](https://www.proff.no/selskap/iota-as/hvittingfoss/internettdesign-og-programmering/IF5NA5H0C2C/). To the best of my knowledge it is not publicly available information what part IOTA AS played or plays. It's also unclear if David is the sole shareholder. * Everyone who followed the project for a while should know what Jinn Labs is. I don't want to go down that rabbit hole now, you can find a lot of informations reading through the old Bitcointalk &amp; NXT forum posts. New information is spare since Jinn has gone in stealth mode for quite a while. * As the Qubic project is now fully in the hand of the IF, it is to assume that the Qubic IP Transfer is done. It is unclear, how much money is involved in this and from where to where it flowed. As IOTA AS and Jinn Labs are mentioned in the same context, one could assume that money flowed from the non-profit IF to those privately owned entities. It is unclear if this is true.  &gt;**Dominik Schiener:**   &gt;   &gt;IOTA AS will have some serious legal issues with the advisor tokens and the impending tax audit.  * To date, it is not public knowledge, what kind of ""serious legal issues"" Dom was talking about. The deal details regarding the advisor tokens are also unknown. * Recently, CFB announced he sold all of his (personal) Iota tokens to avoid conflicts of interest while working on current projects. More on this recent development, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/dt2qve/cfb_adds_some_clarification_regarding_his_tweet/). A potential conflict of interest regarding CFB was already mentioned from Ralf in 2018, see above.  &gt;**Dominik Schiener (towards David):**   &gt;   &gt;great, while you‚Äôre at it and are collecting information, please do make sure that you collect all the other pending information we‚Äôve been waiting for. As that information has actual \*legal implications\* on all of us, so it would be good to resolve those issues once and for all.   &gt;   &gt;\[...\]   &gt;   &gt;anyways, good luck collecting this information. I‚Äôm offline now. All of you should consider the repercussions of your actions, and the way this will affect other issues. Good luck!  * There was pending information with legal implications to all of them (probably Ralf, Popov, CFB, David &amp; Dom as they were part of this discussion). It was on David to provide this information (as Dom is asking him to provide it). David is the owner of IOTA AS. There was some sort of advisor tokens deal. There was some sort of Qubic IP transfer with money involved. If there is a conflict of interest, the IF could lose their non-profit status and all board members would be personally liable to pay taxes. All of those are facts stated in the leak, I don't personally know if they are connected.  &gt;**Ralf Rottmann:**   &gt;   &gt;Just thinking about \*all of the other stuff\* that will come to light, makes me extremely worried. Not for myself. But we are all grown ups.  * This part of the leak was the most mysterious for me, so I posted about it at the time (8th of August 2018) [on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/95qi3b/just_thinking_about_all_of_the_other_stuff_that/). His response was the following:  &gt;Many of you have asked about one of my statements from the recently leaked chat protocol: ‚ÄúJust thinking about *all of the other stuff* that will come to light, makes me extremely worried.‚Äù ‚Äî Reading it out of context in the leaked excerpt might worry you. Let me clarify: I was not referring to anything related to the IOTA protocol, our technology or from the upcoming Black Hat conference. (We now know, the Black Hat presentation was rehashing a one year old story.) My comment was about even more very personal information, that might get public, once we cross the line of fighting these sort of *personal* fights in public. When working so closely with each other‚Äôs in an extremely intense environment, people tend to share a lot of personal information which from time to time makes them vulnerable. With that line, I wanted to remind everyone that no matter how this would play out, we all have a responsibility for each other‚Äôs privacy.  * Continuing in the Leak:  &gt;**Ralf Rottmann:**   &gt;   &gt;I might offer jobs to my direct reports and some of their teams, should the fallout of this crash our valuation and hence render IF unable to pay these people. That‚Äôs all I can offer. Obviously, I will first resign, should this turn out the way I expect it to.  * Ralf [resigned the IF on 29th of March 2019](https://medium.com/@ralf/farewell-iota-foundation-5736d15ae27a) and explains his decision in a medium post. He starts with:  &gt;A while ago, I started to discuss with Dominik and David, to resign from my assignment as an IOTA Foundation Board member and I have now decided to *formally* proceed, as soon as the 2017 and 2018 financial statements and audits of the charitable non-profit have been released to the public.  * By his own words,  the timing of his resignation was in direct relation to the release of the 2017/2018 financial statements and audits  of the non-profit. I am not aware where they have been released to and have not seen them. I assume it was some sort of legal release and they're not publicly available on the internet. * I am not aware of any IF member quitting the IF and joining Ralf at his company grandcentrix. * CFB [joined the IF Board of Directors](https://blog.iota.org/welcome-sergey-ivancheglo-to-the-iota-foundation-board-of-directors-2167ca99e495) shortly after the leak on 14th of August 2018. [He left the IF about one year later](https://blog.iota.org/sergey-ivancheglo-departs-from-the-iota-foundation-d2d9c1c61db6) on 26th of July 2019.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  As I said. I merely intent to provide context and pull together the informations that are publicly available. I'd like to apologize for any linguistic errors as English is not my first language.",Recap of the 2018 Board Discussion Leak

5995,0,"So in the goshimmer subreddit there has been talk about a ‚Äúcolored iota‚Äù feature for post coordicide. As I understand it, a single iota is colored with a hash which ties it to a specific application. Also known as a sticker, this marker can be removed somehow and returned to regular iotas. Other implementation specific questions (who can remove it, only the creator or the current owner?) are unknown. Put another way, it‚Äôs like erc20 tokens but instead of being created from nothing they‚Äôre bound to a single (or multiple?) iotas, causing scarcity and value add for the token without causing fragmentation.   The applications for this feature are, to me, probably the most fascinating facet of this technology. Secure decentralized e-voting at any scale, tokenization/ownership of any asset, digital fiat, concert/entry tickets, reward points, etc. The characteristics of the protocol would extend to this feature, so that means audit logs and feeless p2p exchange.   Given the use cases this route would have to be a major driver of token adoption. Digital fiat alone could cause untold trillions of iotas to be locked up. The cost of issuance would be very low, since a single iota will probably always be a fraction of a fraction of a cent, and being reusable would trigger value in holding a reserve. If used to color for ownership stake in a high value asset (self driving cars, industrial machinery, real estate), coupled with open data on that assets usage patterns, generating passive income could become cheap and easy.   These are just my initial thoughts. Let me know your opinions on colored iotas, major use cases, and it‚Äôs implications for the world.",Let‚Äôs talk colored coins

Also, there happened to be Dominik Schiener (the co-founder of IOTA) tagged in the post. People interpreted this subliminal message as equaling something bigger.  To me it sounded kinda fishy, since there is no mention of IOTA anywhere. I also visited Slush this year where Finnair and Ruuvi demoed this tech and even then, there was no mention of IOTA when I asked about the tech behind it.   The mental acrobatics in people's minds are due to the fact that Dom was tagged in Ruuvi's tweet and Ruuvi has posts in their Lab website about experimenting with IOTA.  Well, I went on and joined Ruuvi's slack channel to ask whether IOTA is utilized in Finnair's Cargo Eye. The CEO answered ""maybe later, right now we are using Kaltio"" (https://ruuvi.slack.com/archives/C6QS3P2Q2/p1512905964000008)  Finnair Cargo Eye does not use IOTA.

6072,0,"I'll start by saying that I'm a big fan of IOTA's tech. I think Shimmer could bring some pretty cool things once it's live. My main concern is that IOTA will not be a great investment, owing to its poor tokenomics model:  * No reason to hold besides as a medium of exchange * No fees, instant transactions       * Great tech, but will ultimately lead to a very high velocity token * For reference, BTC's annual velocity is \~10 (\~$1.5T annual transfers, \~$150B market cap)       * For comparison, BCH (with lower fees) is \~50-100 * At scale, IOTA will most likely have a token velocity of *at least* 100 (am I wrong?) * With a global GDP of $100T, $1B market cap for a v=100 token would be fair value iff 0.1% of global GDP is happening on IOTA  So why is IOTA not massively overvalued? Even if IoT reaches $5T annually within 5 years, and 100% of that is happening on IOTA, it would still be at best 50x higher than now at equilibrium (assuming v=100, it could be even higher).

In the case of IOTA it was the realization that certain problems will prevent the blockchain from fulfilling many of the use-cases which existed (and to an extent still do) only in theory. IOTA is arguably one of the major pioneering projects that took the concept of a DLT and implementing it with a different underlying data structure to solve many of the problems with Blockchain: fees, scaling, and centralization brought about by the need for validators or miners.  The result is a network that can easily handle huge amounts of data, which the creators hope will act as a catalyst for a true machine-to-machine economy, something which goes hand in hand with the emerging technological advancements we‚Äôre seeing in Artificial Intelligence as well as the Internet-of-Things.

6109,0,"I have been watching the IOTA price for a couple of years, and I think I have some feel for it.  Its performance over the last few weeks has been a bit unusual.  Yes, it went up with the alt spike, and promptly went down.  But it is showed surprising resilience.  And even now, it is still holding on to some of its gain. I think also, its volume is a bit higher than usual.  Someone suggested on this board - sorry if I can't remember their name - that IOTA will slowly climb the ranks.  If I remember rightly, the argument was that IOTA would move up the table, perhaps over a period of years, with market capitalization being a secondary issue.  I think this process may be starting, and I think we may be seeing the very first signs of IOTA detaching from other coins.    It could be a long process, and IOTA could be in the top five coins with a lower market capitalization than what we have now.  Then we are just waiting for the next crypto bubble, and we're away.  However we might be talking years, not months.  By the way, I think it is possible that the whole crypto space could be damaged by precious metals.  Gold and silver are starting to move up, and if gold goes much higher, the mainstream will start taking notice.  The hot money could be focusing on metals rather than cryptos - bearing in mind that the market cap of alt coins is fairly close to the value of available above ground silver (I'm taking that as 4 billion ounces, but I accept that my sources may not be entirely accurate).

6125,0,"I will try to make this an objective post and not just shill my bags.  So, what I am arguing for is that IOTA will be able to become THE tamper-proof messaging and payments protocol that will be used by hundreds or even thousands of small and large corporations from all around the globe.  The first point is: do corporates actually need such a solution? The main value proposition of IOTA is that companies will need a solution to stream granular data in a auditable and tamper-proof way, usecases for this can be anything from supply chain tracking, to energy management to datamerketplaces. There are many reports from McKinsey and Co. outlining how important these industries will be in the future and how big the potential market is for a solution to these problems. I think its quite obvious that there is a demand for such services, if not convinced just watch ""100billion reasons why"" by the bIOTAsphere.  But will IOTA be the solution that will satisfy these needs?  In my view there are 3 reasons why IOTA will become the market leader:  **1) Better technology**: to become the leader IOTA needs to have the better tech than all competitors, only this way corporate will use IOTA instead of alternatives. So the question is does IOTA have the best tech on the market? I think the answer is ""not yet but very soon"". As we all know the Tangle is still in its infancy and in its current state it totally unusable for an actual use case. But having a network with ""training wheels"" gave the IF the chance to become the leading institution in DAG research, they now this field better than anyone else, they have the best researches, and they have been working on the problems that DAG architectures face for over 3 years now. And that what allowed the IF to come up with the Coordicide solution. I don't know of any competitor who can show a similar amount of expertise, and these projects will all have to solve the same problems, while IOTA already solved them. In conclusion I think that the experience and know-how that the IF accumulated over the years gives them a unique advantage to bring to the market the best solution.  **2) Market Adoption:** As with all network based systems adoption is key, the value of the network is fully depended on how many people are in it, the more people are already in the bigger the incentive for new people to join. Here again IOTA has a huge advantage over competition. Even though there are no ""real"" applications on IOTA yet there have been many PoCs  with big corporations, this means that 1) these corporations know that IOTA is a potential solution, 2) they have experience in implementing IOTA based solutions, 3) they know what the issues are when implementing a DLT based solutions. So this gives IOTA a big advantage over the competitions as for a competitor to be integrated into a PoC they need to prove that they have a such superior solution (which they probably dont, see point 1) that it is worth it to the company to put the money and effort into integrating it. In conclusion it will always be more valuable for a company to go with a solution that they have worked with before and that other companies are using as well.  **3) STANDARDIZATION:** I can't stress enough how big of a deal this is. As IOTA was the first mover they reached a level of maturity on tech, adoption and organization that made it plausible for them to apply to become an ISO standard (having Dr. Richard Soley onboard helped too). The entire point of a standard is that EVERYONE uses that and not something else. This basically means that its GG for IOTA. No corporation looking for a solution will go with some newcomer instead of an established ISO standard. And even today the fact that IOTA already started this process made it WAY more likely that someone like JLR chose IOTA for their PoC, as they know that in 1.5 years this protocol will be the one everyone uses. In conclusion you CAN NOT COMPETE WITH AN ESTABLISHED STANDARD.  So, to conclude this rant, assuming that there is a multi-billion or even trillion dollar market for tamper-proof messaging and payments protocol, I can see no way that another solution will dominate this market, IOTA is already far to advanced on R&amp;D and Industry adoption for anyone else to catch up. The ISO Standardization makes it impossible for an ""IOTA-Killer"" to gain any relevance, even before the process is fully complete. The huge impact of the network effect in communication and financial tech makes it a winner-take-all situation, and for me its clear that IOTA is the winner.",Why IOTA will make it

However, if we want IOTA to succeed from a market perspective we need to stop being so negative about everything. The founders of IOTA and the IOTA Foundation has delivered on everything they promised since 2015.   Let's look at the facts: The IOTA project is growing with world leading partnerships and experts joining every week, while other projects are firing people and bragging about random updates. The team behind IOTA has always refused to do gimmicks, paying exchanges for listing etc. In the short term this can be frustrating, because you watch projects like TRON ahead of us in the marketcap for these reasons alone. I ask everyone to think 1-2 years into the future. What does TRON or almost any of the other projects have? NOTHING. What does IOTA have? A steadily growing team and real world adoption from some of the biggest corporations in the world. Let's rejoice and be positive!

I don't think  Coinbase is going to list IOTA any time soon (coordicide?), and if Binance.US doesn't list IOTA, then I think we're in for a real hit.  In terms of IOTA's newsflow, much of the news is technical, and maybe difficult for the average Moonboy to understand.  Even the STM news was ignored.  All this may not be a bad thing, if one is looking out a few years, but I think the exchange listing issue has the potential to cause serious damage to the rankings and the dollar price.

I took some time to translate it roughly.   &amp;#x200B;  I'll abbreviate her with M.  &amp;#x200B;  The other male person with H (Host).  &amp;#x200B;  And there's another person talking near the end I call O (Other).  &amp;#x200B;  M: In Holland we do a lot to stimulate public transport but if it's up to Janguar Land Rover you should just continue driving.  Because they are doing a test/pilot where you will be paid when you take your car for a ride.  H: I have a Jaguar so tell me how I can start earning money!  M: Well it's sounds a bit nicer than it is and that is also the case.  The company applies a new smart technology called the smart wallet and currently only the models Jaguar FP and Land Rover Range Rover Velar will be equipped with it.  These models will automatically gather information about your location, travel conditions, battery status but also traffic jams and potholes, but here is the catch. Because all this information can be forwarded to your navigation system or local authorities.  So you are paid for sharing of data. But apart from this privacy aspect which you can debate about there is another reason why this new system is being talked about a lot.  Because instead of being paid in Bitcoin or Euros you are getting paid in the token IOTA.  H: Hang on, so your car gathers data and this is personalized because they need to know how to pay you, but IOTA, what is that?  M: IOTA is something different than Bitcoin also called the Internet of Things currency. Bitcoin runs on computers and they verify transactions and then those are added to the blockchain. But with IOTA that uses the Tangle and that's not a chain of blocks but a large pile of data so all data is put on that large pile and what is very nice about it is that IOTA has 0 transaction costs and next to that is capable of handling an infinite amount of transactions. So it is super suitable for microtransactions. So better than Bitcoin which is very expensive and better than the Euro.  And to be clear there is no Jaguar coin but it's the platform of IOTA which will use it's token for this machine economy.  Jaguar says you will also be able to earn tokens by joining things like carpooling but you will also be able to actually use those tokens again. For instance for toll roads, parking or charging your batteries.  So you get a parallel economy.  You car can earn and pay money by itself.  H: So like a driving bank?  M: Yes indeed.  H: Well then it's called a Bank Rover.  All: lol hahah roflol.  H: Ok so when do these cars come to market?  M: Well that's not really known yet but from the press release I can understand that there is a lot of attention was given to the testing and they are really continuing this development. So it seems the world tomorrow is coming closer and closer.  O: Well so being Jaguar you already have to convince people to share their data, which will be a bit hard to do. And then you also need to convince people to it will be IOTA and what that actually is and means.  H: Oh but I wouldn't even do that, I would just say: the next time you are at a tollbooth in France you don't have to pay, because your car is doing that for you.  M: Very smart.  O: Ah yes, then I understand.",Jaguar Land Rover news in well known Dutch morning news radio show (+ translation)

I hope this type of post and question is not unpopular :/  Having learned that people here are mostly honest and helpful with all sorts of questions, I would like to hear some opinions on how you would handle the situation I am in... When I first heard of the project the price was 4‚Ç¨/IOTA and the roadmap seemed so incredible, that I invested 600‚Ç¨ (Which is quite a big sum of money for me) all in one go, without asking anybody if they would invest in the same way... I dont want to do the same mistake again, but I still don't know how much I should buy when.  Now I have got 2000‚Ç¨ that is ready to be invested and I already have a portfolio with 90% IOTA. I do my own research and try to stick to the rule, only to invest in projects I can grasp the idea and the usefulness of and I did plan to diversify my portfolio but due to the lack of projects that were able to convince me as much as IOTA- I just kept on buying \~100‚Ç¨ IOTA every month.   What would you do in my situation? How much would you invest when and in what. I strongly believe in IOTAs future but I know about the eggs and the basket thing... Do you guys just give a shit and are all in on IOTA, or do you invest in other projects that are risky but with a promising future? Bitcoin would probably still rise and be a safe bet, but it seems like stocks to me, where good money is only made if you are able to invest 10.000‚Ç¨ for example.  I think it is very possible that the price will keep on falling so I dont know if I should just wait for a lower price (fe 0,15cents) and invest the 2000 then.. or invest 500‚Ç¨/month for four months, ooor just invest everything now with the happy feeling of having bought IOTA at such a low price.  &amp;#x200B;  Sorry again if my questions annoy you or if they seem silly...

6242,0,"Think on a global basis, how much work can be done for $5M. That is what the IF has set aside for research done outside the foundation. Let's say that a good researcher averages $100k per year. This grant would pay for 50 researchers to work for a year, or 25 for 2 years. I would think that a couple of major breakthroughs would happen. But the price has gone down. I have to think that Iota is in a bear alt market and current prices are way undervalued. This is a huge buy signal and you should all start buying. But wait until my order fills ;)",$5M is a big chunk of money
6243,0,"IOTA is one of the few projects left that I actually believe in, and it‚Äôs difficult not having any more expendable fiat to buy at these prices. So, figured we could discuss the possible future of this project in terms of monetary gain. Despite believing in the tech 100%, I also see an opportunity to make some real gains as the project thrives.  To me, ‚Äúmaking it‚Äù means having enough money to live off of through yearly withdrawals equal to the ‚Äúsafe rate,‚Äù so about 3% a year. I think about $50k a year is enough for me to be content without having to work, so that‚Äôs about $1.8M post-tax dollars, ~$2.5M pre-tax.  So, that would mean 10 GIOTA hitting $250 per MIOTA. Seems pretty high, but I think that price is possible far down the road. On a more short term perspective, I think $50 per MIOTA is much more realistic for a 3-year outlook given steady progress on Coordicide and Qubic. That would mean needing 50 GIOTA.  Now, ‚Äúmaking it‚Äù means different things for everyone. So, what does it mean to you? Buying a house in full? Hitting a million dollars?

I have been in the tech space for almost 2 decades now and do invest and love a good speculation but, for some reason, never got around to really having the time to focus on really digging in. Well, that time has come and I have been studying the vast swath of subject for awhile now and am ready to get my feet wet as I learn more.   I plan on a little DCA with some of the bigger players, but am interested in speculative and alt coins as well. Of particular interest for some time now has been IOTA. Unfortunately, I am in the US and waited too long for buying into IOTA easily as it seems now. Didn't have Binance already so the ""easy"" way has been pulled away..for now (hopefully).   This hasn't dissuaded me though and I am still looking to buy, but researching possible ways to do so. Best I can gather is that I could transfer some BTC or ETH from Coinbase to Coinex, exchange for IOTA, then pull into my wallet. Is this still possible, and is it still about the best (only) way to get some?

6426,0,"I'm working in financial industry for quite a while and just saw some recent post about the depression they get based on IOTA price performance. Here are some advises I sincerely hope you could consider in this market:  1.Treat your crypto portfolio as security assets. No matter whether you think it is taxable or not, think it like a zero-coupon bond that instead of you purchase at a known discount, you purchase it at a price that is lower than what you will sell in the future.  1.1  As a security, it generates yield. Go look for what yield means  2.Think yourself as a corporate. There are three kinds of security assets for a corporate: Trading Security; Held-for-Sale;Held-to-Maturity  2.1  The difference is how long you will hold for the security. Trading security means a couple of days to month, held-for-sale usually 1-3 years, held-to-maturity means more than 3 years.   2.2 Think about what crypto belongs to what kind. Pump and Dump coins are trading securities.  Well established crypto should be treated as held-for-sale. I treat IOTA as held-to-maturity as it is not well established yet and it is also not PnD.  2.3 **Recognize your crypto gain according to the kind of crypto**. Same as corporate, recognize trading crypto on a Mark-to-Market basis to net income, recognize held-for-sale crypto like other comprehensive income in an annual basis, meaning that should it not be your operating income generation. Do not recognize held-to-maturity gain into income, recognize it as equity. (if you compare your IOTA gain to PnD or etherem/bitcoin/ripple, you are not doing apple to apple comparison because they are not same category.)  3. **Assess your risk tolerance for your sensitivity to implied yield.** The higher the maturity duration, the higher the sensitivity/risk is to yield, so IOTA has the biggest risk to yield. Go search for what does it mean for **Macaulay duration**.  **3.1 Think about when do you want to get out of IOTA.** This is very important. It should depends on your age and goal. I would like to get out of it by 2021.  **3.2 Think about whether you are willing to accept more price risk or reinvestment risk.** If you wish to get out of the crypto before Macaulay duration, you will suffer more price risk and if you wish to get out of the crypto after Macaulay duration, you will suffer more reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk meaning that you cann't find a better yield in the future at a reasonable cost. **This is why a lot of people are losing faith about IOTA but cannot get an answer. You overestimate your unwillingness for the price risk and IOTA has the biggest price risk since it's duration is the longest. People cannot help you because they treat it as held-to-maturiy and people talking about in terms of fundamental.**  **3.3 Adjust your portfolios' Macaulay duration by adjusting your security weights. There is nothing wrong for diversification. It doesn't mean you don't believe in IOTA, it means you don't want to suffer excessive price risk.**  By having trading crypto and held-for-sale crypto, you are lower your porfolio's duration and in this situation, you are lowering you price risk and increase you reinvestment risk. Do it, there is nothing wrong with it. People have different risk preference.  4. Enjoy your life. Do not get too focus on IOTA and crypto in general. Let IF do the hard work as they should.  &amp;#x200B;  **IOTA Strategy Risk:**  I'd like to talk about some strategy risk in IOTA foundation which initially was my concern but they are improving it. (It's not about tech)  The biggest risk to me is the way they think about marketing. Maybe because this is a crypto industry, every marketing seems to be a way to pump the price. **It is not.** The biggest benefit from marketing is always reputation and exposure. By having a good marketing strategy, you can gain better talent and have more people and organization willing to use your product (less FUD). If you are involved in discord, you will still see most IF members have passive attitude towards marketing.   Another big risk is project prioritization. If you have heard about Jinn, ICT or AI garth or maybe we could count qubic (debatable), then you probably know what I mean.  &amp;#x200B;  IOTA improvement:  They are approaching U.S. exchanges to adopt IOTA. To me, this is the biggest improvement of the philosophy of IOTA foundation. Though some members still have the argument that it is exchange decision, we finally see people from the top is willing to do the right thing about getting exposure.  &amp;#x200B;  Please no TLDR, if you have concern, read it .",How to feel more comfortable holding IOTA in the upcoming bull market and what IF can do better

6471,0,"Considering the state of the market a decade after Bitcoin and half a decade after mainstream media coverage began, it is beyond clear that the future of cryptocurrencies relies on industrial adoption.   The tribalism and endless bullshit peddled by scammers trying to extract as much value as possible is unproductive, tiring and dangerous. It's also totally expected: distributed ledger technology as it stands now is the perfect cocktail of complexity, lack of adoption and extreme potential. This gives manipulators free reign to lie, scam and embezzle, all the while pretending to be 'leaders'.   When you meet a supporter for a specific project, ask them to describe how they see adoption happening and what are the economics of their token.   To fully convert IOTA's current market cap from purely speculative to entirely sustained by real demand, only 10% of the current ~12B IoT-ready devices would need access to $1 in IOTA. This may seem like a very realistic goal, but it's a massive one nonetheless, because it assumes that these devices are holding the token at all times instead of performing conversions from fiat as needed. 10% adoption is also a massive share for such a market. Nevertheless, with over 10x the number of devices expected to be online by 2030 and greater stability of the token's price as real demand increases, the upward bound is insane: a $1T+ market cap could very well be possible.",It is beyond clear that the future of cryptocurrencies relies on industrial adoption.

Dom confirms that  ""the IOTA team advocates One standard, One protocol, One **token** for the entire machine to machine economy"".

Reading online newspapers, there seems to be very little mention of the explosion in the Bitcoin price over the last 6 weeks.  In other words, ordinary people are not yet aware of what is going on.  Also, new institutional money may be moving into BTC.  It's interesting, also, how many long-time commentators on cryptos were calling for a big correction in BTC, and were claiming massive resistance at 5800 to 6000.  The dynamics appear to have changed.  Where does this leave IOTA?  If 40c falls then, as I have now said on numerous occasions, I don't believe it will be long before we're at $1.50.    Am I happy?  Not really.  I was hoping cryptos would crash and burn through the Spring, and that IOTA would hit 15c.  By early April it was clear that wasn't going to happen.",Train leaving the station?

I've seen many posts in here (mainly in the last 6 months) from the part of uncertain holders who have been frustrated by the growth of IOTA, despite the good news we've been receiving basically every week. These people all had one thing in common: a complete lack of awareness of what made each IOTA valuable. In December of 2017, the /r/IOTA subreddit went from ~12k (if I remember correctly) subscribers to jut above 100k, almost entirely from the crazy bull run that brought each IOTA from a ~$0.30 valuation to just above $5.20.  Guys, we picked up a ton of noobs who bought IOTA in the same manner that they bought ADA or XRP: by closing their eyes and spreading themselves in various, completely random projects. Now, we've lost the overwhelming majority of them, which means their funds have been consolidated into much more solid hands.  We're also on the verge of getting some important news concerning Qubic *and* Coordicide, which will be sure to generate some interest. All in all, the timing doesn't ""feel"" special, but I can almost assure you that it is: we've crept back into the top gainers for the week, despite a slow start and **blatant price suppression** following the Jaguar/Land Rover news.

6613,0,"This post isn't really specific to IOTA, but probably applies to all Alt coins.  At what level of BTC will Alts start going up?  If you hold BTC, when do you transfer into Alts?  I think we do have to consider the possibility that BTC and Alts are different asset classes.  BTC has established itself, and is losing its risk.  The Alts, by contrast, are as risky as ever, and very few are likely to survive - particularly those outside the top 20.  Personally I believe IOTA will survive, because there is enough about it that is distinct, and also it was lucky enough to raise funds and create the IF.  Yet I'm thinking that if one holds BTC, one should avoid diversifying until it is much higher.  Perhaps $20,000.  Even close to $50,000.  You also have to remember, with regard to Alt/BTC correlation, that it might only go positive again if and when BTC starts tanking - because then BTC and Alts will be going in the same direction.

I was really happy when all the news we had this month came out but... no market reaction followed. I'm not blind and I look at other major cryptos and see that they've already broken (or close to breaking) their Yearly lows in BTC ratio.  Honestly I think I made a huge and very expensive mistake when started accumulating IOTA in Jan'19. Right now I see to possible scenarios on the table:   1) Bitcoin goes for a big correction and IOTA will fall sharply in USD value and maybe slow down the fall in BTC value (but if we close the week in such a rejection candle with volume - we're done)   2) Bitcoin jumps to 7-8k in a week or two and IOTA will seriously go to 0 in BTC value, because we're currently at the last support before we fall into the abyss     https://i.redd.it/rxns8o4lg6w21.png  What I don't see right now is a sharp reversal to the upside.

6636,0,"Zero competitors. There is \*\*not a single other protocol\*\* you could use for IoT right now that offers value transfers. And on top of that IOTA also offers data integrity.  Please correct me if I'm wrong and there is some serious competitor. I'm aware there are a few low cap cryptos that market themselves as solutions for IoT but they are all blockchain based and let's be honest: they won't.  &amp;#x200B;  I think many of you are all underestimating things. You are focussed on price. And you miss that the real adoption is already happening right now. In the last week we got a fucking \*\*PARTNERSHIP\*\* with Jaguar and another one with the Austin Transportation Department.  &amp;#x200B;  Just imagine being Jaguar and looking for what to use to enable a smart wallet. They realized that cars will need wallets in the future. That's not astounding at all. They need it for charging, they need it for parking, they need it to pay highway tolls, they need it for for platooning and all other things were cars cooperate. It's no secret that cars in the future will have a wallet. But what are they going to use to implement this? Fucking PayPal? This won't work. You wanna pay a few bucks of fee for every micro-payment? And there won't be a Jaguar token as Dom pointed out, you simply can't have a token for every car. And a driving car will not always have perfect internet access, so it also gotta be partition tolerant.  &amp;#x200B;  Now what are you going to use? If there wasn't IOTA the answer would be: ""Well we gotta wait a few more years until there is a solution."". But there is IOTA. And I don't see any other protocol you could use right now. It really looks like IOTA has the best starting conditions possible. IOTA is soaking up every company that wants to work with what currently exists. Never underestimate first mover advantage, I think this is something heavily overlooked.  &amp;#x200B;  I remember when I first heard about IOTA and though IoT is some utopic thing of the far future. That's not true anymore. Companies are getting serious. They are heavily investing and exploring. They are right now building the IoT. And today there really is no alternative to IOTA. Either you are inventing your own use case specific solution (""JaguarCoin""), you wait until there is an industry standard available (which you can't do because you can wait in this market) or you use IOTA. IOTA is positioning itself perfectly and it will necessarily be kept up by many more companies in the future until there is a viable alternative but by then IOTA would already have the clear network effect.",Here is the one most important thing why I think IOTA will succeed.

6674,0,I see only good news coming out. But the price has been in free fall while the rest of the market has been very bullish. Anyone knows why is that?,"hey, why has the price fell so much?"
6675,0,"Hey guys.   I'm a big fan of Iota in principle. Seems like a super smart project with a large team of very well qualified people working on it. Clearly the number of partnerships attest to lots of other people and companies seeing the potential in it too. So it's obvious from a conceptual/tech side that it's super exciting. But on the investment side of things I'm a little confused.  Given how many smart people are backing this thing I'm sure that I'm missing something obvious but I'd be grateful if someone could explain to me how the fluctuating price of the currency wouldn't be a problem in a future where Iota becomes the default currency for m2m transactions?  Like say Iota really succeeds, wildly, dramatically and billions upon billions of Iota are traded everyday by machines. Cars, phones, sat navs, computers whatever. All these devices are just trading data or services for Iota. What's to stop me buying loads of iota and pushing the price up? If Iota is used widely. We know there will be demand. What's to stop the price just climbing ever upwards to the point where it's no longer worth buying things with iota anymore because youd be better off holding onto the currency? Or will the price of things always be paired to Fiat and fluctuate instantaneously?  But even then, surely there must hypothetically be a point where you could push the value of 1 iota up over .10c or something? Wouldn't that then undo all the aims of the currency? You can't make micro transactions if there aren't small enough units available.  And if transactions can be done instantly with no fees, won't there be millions of machines trading the currency against different Fiat pairs? Taking advantage of fluctuations in the prices of different currencies? Would you end up with auto fx trading machines using the tangle? Utilising very fast feeless micro transactions to game currency markets? Or would that act as a stabilising mechanism on the price of Iota? Would that sort of thing eat up the bandwidth of the tangle as well?  I don't know enough about how these sorts of things work but I guess that national currencies are inflationary for a reason. So they can keep the value of the currency roughly stable.  But with a deflationary asset this isn't the case right? In the same way that the dramatic price volatility with Bitcoin is the largest obstacle to it having real use as a currency. After all why buy something for 10btc today when it could be 8btc tomorrow? Couldn't the same be true for you as a user? You buy, let's say 30 iota for the year. You feed that into your car so the car can buy the data it needs. But then loads of other people buy Iota. That iota is suddenly worth a lot more. And the value of it keeps climbing. The data you bought yesterday for little $2, the money you used to buy it is now worth $4 let's say. Wouldn't you then say, ok let's stop spending this magic money because it might be worth a lot more tomorrow or next year?   TL:DR If loads of people buy Iota and the price goes up will that have a negative impact on iotas utility?",Isn't price volatility disruptive to iota's aims as a currency?

6686,0,"... and whenever I had this feeling with any coin, its likely to go up in a craze just days afterwards.     Look, I entered the market in may 2017. I converted some ETH to iota at 0.4USD, at 0.25USD and even at 0.16 USD!   &amp;#x200B;  I had a lot of coins, Tokencard, TenX, OMG, EOS... to name some that generated value. I even put like 3 ETH in eBTC (you can look for it on google, its a shame) and shitcoins like this. In the end I put ALL I ever had in crypto into IOTA or sold some at low points.      I made the run from 0.3 to 5.8, sold like 4Gi at 0.7 - hey doubled up and than it went to the sky - and 1,5Gi at 4,0) (which I reinvested mostly in Nano/Raiblocks - all lost forever because I was not able to take it out of Bitgrail - FUCK Bomber by the way) and luckily in two used Kites to begin Kitesurfing. Yea, two used kites is what I have left of a little fortune, what came from nothing and went to nothing.   Right now I think IOTA is a huge gamble. Actually, I think its a 50/50 gamble because there is no guarantee the coordinator will be removed. Or maybe that another proyects makes something better. Kill me on that, if you like to, but in the end, its the truth.      BUT if IF makes it happen, and we all IF can make it happen, than we should come back to those end-2017 levels + the FOMO bonus. Bitcoin hodlers had to wait nearly 6 years (Dec, 2013) for crazy gains and another 4 years to recover from the crash. I clearly missed the oportunity to get out of the market in 2017. Like all of us, I thought I am too clever to pull out and its better to have no fortune than have a little fortune (its clearly not).      I ate a lot of shit in this market. And if IOTA drops to 0.15 I will feel still a little dumber. But now I am here for the long run. IOTA can recover and actually believe so, but only in the long run. Right now I feel like I should sell, have some money, maybe do vacacions or spend it on a little business idea I have. But this is normally the point, when lows are reached (remember depression phase). I look at prices once a week and normally regret it, maybe truning to once a month. I will go for it and hold. I will sell with a plan, at 1.00, at 3.00 and at 5.00 and the rest for the long long long term gamble.      Best regards",I have the urge feeling I should sell IOTA

Is it possible everything will pump a ridiculous amount while this happens? Again, yes. If that worries you, set aside a certain amount of cash and gamble with the likes of Litecoin and EOS and BNB and BAT.  #The last time I visited a subreddit as fearful, indecisive and frustrated as this one was when everyone invest in Ripple complained that it was stagnant while everything else was rising.  I remember a thread made to remind people that IOTA now had a market cap higher than Ripple's (it lasted a week or so). What happened after? Ripple went from $0.20 to $3.75.  As far as I'm concerned, the market remains insanely illogical and relies on a very delicate blend of wash trading and manipulation. The FOMO/FUD cycle is very real, but the good news is that IOTA has an actual product. One that is just as game-changing as the first smartphones.  That being said, an $800M valuation is serious money. Yes, much of the market is leagues higher than this, but as I said before: it's *insanely* irrational. So, don't be surprised if we drop a few more positions, but don't be mad if you sell and we randomly start shooting up either.",The last time I saw a subreddit as angsty as this one was in December 2017...

6712,0,"If you're here, you're interested in the potential of IOTA, especially what a successful implementation would mean for the price of IOTA tokens. That's my case, too, however the industrial applications and their impact on business are far more interesting to me than the investment opportunity. Since I haven't seen anyone formulate a clear (albeit purely speculative) picture of a future for IOTA, allow me to paint my own.  **2019:** Not much changes. Positive sentiment in the market leads Bitcoin to hit the $7K mark again, while current ranks are more or less maintained. IOTA reaches up to $0.50 during the summer, then stagnates/slowly slips again. Development continues and the first use cases are unveiled, but the market pays little attention to them. Bitcoin still dominates the news cycle, despite essentially no progress on the dev side.  **2020:** IOTA begins the year around $0.40. A very short, yet significant dip in the entire market leads people to panic and is then followed by big growth: Bitcoin goes back over $9500 for a little while and other coins go up 20-55%. In the very middle of this run, a big scandal erupts in the cryptocurrency space as one of the first real piece of investigative journalism comes out, exposing the EOS project as a massive fraud. EOS barely slips out of the top 20. The IOTA coordinator is phased out in favor of a distributed coordinator, while full coordicide is being discussed increasingly often.  Summer of 2020 sees a lot of people who were hoping to see the bull run continue extremely confused, as the market turns seriosuly bearish again. The IOTA foundation establishes its North American headquarters in silicon valley and rumors start to circulate. The price barely budges and ends the summer at $0.65, with the unveiling of 7 Smart City projects in the works and the end of phase one for the Taipei project, which has increased in scope. Fall and winter are fairly uneventful, however news outlets go full steam ahead and talk of Bitcoin and Ethereum fill various programs. Still barely any mention of anything other than those two.   **2021:** This year begins with a bang at Hannover Messe, as Fujitsu unveils its fully autonomous smart factory concept, which rely on Bosch hardware, Qubic and IOTA. An initial release of Qubic is rolled out, with more to come during the year. IOTA quickly jumps to $1.00, then steadily climbs to $3.00 during the early summer. For the first time, mainstream news outlets are covering IOTA. Volkswagen announces 20 IOTA-powered charging stations working right now with IOTA, compatible with native wallets installed in VW, and Audi hybrid and electric cars. A week later, a partnership with Nissan, which publicizes its purchase of IOTA tokens, promises hundreds of IOTA-enabled stations in Canada and the US within 3 years and wallets available for 2022 or newer models. Bitcoin slides back up to the $7500 levels and stabilizes. Still no ETFs in play.  Q3 and Q4 see the price of IOTA remain somewhat stable, going down to $2.00 at some point, then bouncing back. Academic groups lead the way towards implementing Qubic to perform decentralized computation. Taipei unveils the beginning of the Private ID program, which digitizes a large part of government-issued documents and allows wallet-enabled vehicles to automatically pay for parking, speeding tickets, tolls and more. The Taipei MRT (metro) begins a test run of IOTA. The year closes at $3.15/MIOTA and $7200/BTC.  **2022:** Things start to happen extremely fast. The pressure on small businesses to offer payments by IOTA grows, so they begin to accommodate customers who come in and pay directly with their phones. After much trial and error in the coordicide project, the network is large and polished enough to completely remove it. IOTA becomes the first fully decentralized, altruistic, secure and feeless cryptocurrency. MOIA announces the results of five years of R&amp;D, alongside its fully autonomous ride-sharing vehicle, the Atlas. Mobility begins to change in Berlin, Hamburg and Helsinki. Plans to expand all over central Europe, North America and China are announced. IOTA quickly jumps to $8.00 by the end of Q1.  In Q2, Novo Nordisk announces its use of the Tangle protocol for audit trails and supply chain management. Samsung announces its 'Smart World' ecosystem, which includes appliances and other machines, allowing them to connect to each other and be programmed to automatically make purchases using IOTA. A dozen other companies make similar announcements. The price of an IOTA reaches 50$ at its peak in July, then gets slashed down to $30 for a short while and stabilizes around $35. IOTA is now all over the news. Bitcoin goes down to $5000, then quickly drops even more, ending the year at $3300.  **2023:** the Lightning network is fully released just as the price of an individual Bitcoin slips back down under $1000 for the first time in over 6 years. ""Programmable economy"" becomes the buzzword of the year, and 5% of all worldwide factories have begun conversion into automatic demand-centric manufacturing hubs. Kicking off in Houston, Texas, the first city-wide self-balancing peer-to-peer energy grid is launched, using IOTA as currency. By April, 1 MIOTA is valued at just under $80. By May, enthusiasts celebrate the billionth device connected to the Tangle. The network keeps speeding up and reaches an average of 1 second for confirmation.",Market predictions based on realistic (yet purely fictional) scenarios.

6724,0,"I know the title is a stupid question but hear me out.  I‚Äôm awaiting to buy more IOTA. However, I think BTC will drop to at least mid 4,000‚Äôs (like 3,000‚Äôs) in the next couple of weeks. So I‚Äôm minded to wait.   On the other hand, I keep seeing MIOTA/BTC is the lowest it‚Äôs ever been in ages. So is there a scenario where BTC massively drops, but IOTA doesn‚Äôt drop the same amount in correlation as it‚Äôs already so low. Thus, there‚Äôs no point in actually waiting and I might aswell buy some BTC with GBP on Coinbase then trade it to IOTA now?   Basically how to you work out how much IOTA  you‚Äôre actually getting for your fiat when your using a coin such as Bitcoin as an intermediary?",Utterly confused about Fiat to Bitcoin then Bitcoin to IOTA conversions
6725,0,"My point is about iota/btc I will just put in some $ numbers for the ‚Äûonly usd matters‚Äú people as well  So just to summarize the current price action.  1.). The current btc pump started on April 2nd (btc price about 4150$ iota price about 0.31$)  2.).  Btc jumped to a high of about 5300 +30% iota to a high of about .37$  +20%  3.).  Btc has stabilized at around 5k while iota has stabilized at .31$   4.). Iota volume has picked up pretty significantly and even on Binance its in the top 5 to 12 for most traded pairs.  You already see that even if btc is still significantly higher than on April 1  Iota is already back where we were as if no pump at all happened. This is obviously because we are on a post 2017 absolut low point in iota/btc. So up until here it‚Äôs nothing new and pretty obvious.   So the question is why is iota getting crushed against btc/eth?  Well as already stated multiple times btc/eth is a fiat gateway to the cryptospace. Since there arent many direct iota/fiat exchanges right now but unfortunately this also means that its the man exitgate for the cryptospace. Since one probably cant throw a couple of hundred GI on a direct fiat exchange without getting into issues (limits, price etc) the only way to exit iota is over btc and eth and then to fiat.  So to me this looks like somebody big is cashing out of iota. Whoever that is (maybe an insider who leaves the project, or an early investor etc.) we Had only 2 positive days since that bullrun started. This just can‚Äôt be without an explanation behind it and I think the only possible answer is that someone is using the current bullrun for cashing out. It‚Äôs the perfect situation to get out of  a few TI without crashing the market while doing it. Otherwise there would be a steady rise together with bitcoin. Maybe not in the same magnitude but it would definitely be a little bit positive. So this leaves me with the only explanation that somebody is sitting on the offer side of the market and is happy to sell his iotas at a price of min. .30$ and doesnt realy care it it‚Äôs.37 or .30$ as long as he gets out.  Don‚Äôt come and try to shit on me for posting this. I haven‚Äôt sold a single Iota and I‚Äôm not planning in doing so,  but for the first time I have stopped my monthly iota purchase of a few hundred bucks simply because this price action right now looks to me as if I don‚Äôt know something very important happening right now. As long as this continues I won‚Äôt put any more money into the project.  For everybody who‚Äôs coming now and says that I‚Äôm stupid for not buying at these low prices and there is more for them to buy. Let me say I‚Äôm happy for everyone who picks up iota at these levels and might has tremendous gains in the future but just think about it since you saying and doing this for a while now it seems that you‚Äôre the significant minority not only now but also the last couple of weeks and you shouldn‚Äôt underestimate the market and it‚Äôs force I have learned that too many times the hard way.",Sad but highly likely explanation for the current price dump

I think any reasonable business model or an innovation should be able to convey the value proposition shortly and in simple words.  1. What is the point of having IOTA token for the data transfer? 2. What is the point of buying IOTA (from the investor perspective or a private person) if you are not owning any share of the organisation &amp; you do not get any product for it (except of the useless token which is loosing your $$$). I do not believe that someone is buying it just for altruistic reasons willing to burn his hard earned money.¬¥without having any sight of multiplying his money. The progress can be made together with profit. 3. What is the point or advantage of not reusable address? Security? - hell no, because if you re-use it it is less secure than any other financial product on the market (bank, paypal, other crypto). The progress is in re-usability!!! 4. What is the point of having anti-inflationary design of currency which loose more value &amp; purchase power/ year then a currency issued by government 5.

So I wondered, who has been selling? With the constant downward pressure, it should be from large holders. Who are the large holders? The early adopters who paid a few hundred dollars per Tiota. It could be a collective small fry who have lost 80% or more and decided to sell now but they shouldn't make up too much of the volume.   What about the founders?

6749,0,Hi guys  I know this post probably gets downvoted into oblivion within a few hours but I still want to bring it up because it starts to concern me. ( I hold on to my Iotas and have no intention to sell any of them)  Since the last Pump we saw BTC higher about 20% and other shitcoins like Bcash up 70% and even IOST (a IOT coin as well) up 85%. Since we always complained in the downturn that it was all due to the correlation to bitcoin that Iota was down so much and even more since altcoins tend to move more than btc itself but if I now look at Iota with a plus of about 13% one sees that IOTA/BTC price is nearly at its absolute low (not including its very early days of course). So Iota is actually in a absolutely brutal downtrend and its recent pump in USD is only due to the pump in btc. If it wasn‚Äôt for that iota would actually be much lower today. I start to ask myself why this happens? The low volume has maybe to do something with it (no washtrading from the IF like other coins) but this cannot be the only explanation? The thing I‚Äôm concerned themost is that this trend continues and iota will further fall and fall and fall not only in mktcap but also in the rankings until its out of the top 20 and then top 50s and so on and on until its just another top 100 shitaltcoin that has no legitimacy or any reason of existence like most of those microcap coins.  I know I will get alot of hate for this but this is no fud attempt I keep holding on my Iotas cause I think it‚Äôs one of the best if not the best concept and tech out there but like in the real business world the best tech is not always the one that will succeed.,Iota continues its fall

However, with a new job it has been extremely hard for me to follow the project. Honestly the most I do is check the price like once a month. So here's my question: Is it easy to take my investment off an exchange and place in the Trinity wallet? I hear it's now working well and functional. As a follow up question, could I just leave it in the wallet and forget, or would I have to maintain it in some way? I want to truly want to forget about it for a while.

Did not sell any at the top and am still hodling). Now in the bear market, I ask myself what gives the token value? And I can't seem to come up with an answer.  BTC for example, was originally supposed to be a digital currency, but now it seems to be finding it's niche as a digital gold. Scarcity is what makes BTC valuable, which makes sense to me. (Disclaimer: I do not hold any BTC).  What also makes sense to me, is how the Iota Foundation could grow in value. With greater adoption of iota and the tangle and more use cases, the company will grow and be worth more as a result. I just can't seem to make the connection on what makes the token valuable. In reality you would think a token that does not wildly fluctuate would be much better off for any use case.

7067,0,"Why I believe IOTA is changing the industry?  IOTA is quietly developing a layer of groundbreaking ecosystem where it enables a true decentralized, fee-less network, where companies and individuals will be able to build thousands of applications within it.  IOTA was the first not-for-profit foundation registered in Germany.  Why does this matter? Simple, accountability. IOTA is not just a small group of developers and researchers, they are doing everything by the books, to enable the next generation and be the leader in the crypto space. We see the team growing on a weekly basis.  Jinn, Qubic and other projects within IOTA.  IOTA is becoming so large and yet a lot of people can't see it. There are tons of projects within IOTA right now that you would need a lot of time to count. The ecosystem is growing everyday and there's really nothing that can stop it.  Ignore the FUD and look to the future.  So what IOTA has a coordinator, so what there's problems that need addressing, so what people say IOTA is bad. Like any other company or foundation, you address problems and fix issues and continue on.  DON'T let people tell you what to do. Do your own research! Trust me, you won't regret doing that, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.   We see NOW how the blockchain technology is being affected by how poorly it was designed, mining companies are shutting down because of the current market, electricity costs etc. IOTA saw that years ago. Cryptocurrencies forking and splitting to find a better solution, and yet, solves nothing in the long run.  Just do your own research and you'll be fine.

A USD &lt;--&gt; IOTA exchange (for Americans).  It seems like there's been the promise of US based exchanges supporting IOTA for quite some time. With the release of the IOTA Hub, it was insinuated that it would be coming ""soon""... I'm sick of having to buy Ethereum so that I can then spend more fees to trade to Iota.  Not only is this a convenience issue, but a USD &lt;--&gt; IOTA exchange would greatly help open up the US market. This doesn't just likely increase the token price. IOTA is primarily a European interest at the moment. As IOTA is more accessible to the US market, more people on this side of the Atlantic will have exposure and access to the technology and that means more people in the community are available to develop, support, and evangelize the tech.",I'm sick of buying Ethereum

It‚Äôs quite complex for a newcomer to be in IOTA : BTC, Coinbase, Binance, seed, Trinity . It‚Äôs not really intuitive right?  It would be better for me to have the ‚ÄòIOTA official wallet‚Äô for IOTA.  Especially with the scandal of the fake seed generator and the bad reputation that it brought for IOTA. It demonstrates how names are important and how people can be fooled easily.  To keep visible the work of the Trinity team, this name could appear on the loading screen : IOTA official wallet - created by the Trinity team   In short : as a standard user, Trinity wallet is for me the best wallet with one tiny flaw : the name.

However, after a lot of research I see potential in the project and it could be the IoT standard if everything pans out as hoped and they can see off the competition. I have some reservations but the developers are obviously clever and visionary. I also like the fact that this isn‚Äôt blockchain tech as I feel that the slow transactional speeds tied to blockchain are a massive issue, one which may never be satisfactorily resolved. If they can get real traction on some of their PoC‚Äôs with big industry actors like Bosch and VW then the sky is the limit (if the real use cases are implemented). The fact they are based in Germany ‚Äì one of the global epicentres of high end manufacturing ‚Äì fills me with some confidence as it‚Äôs very much the place to be with a product like this.   &amp;#x200B;  If the price gets to $35 at some point in the distant future (5 to 7 years) my 2.5 Gi would be worth circa $100K and the Iota mcap would be $100B. That isn‚Äôt beyond the realms of possibility if IOTA becomes an IoT powerhouse with a decent market share. No doubt it will take years though as the industry is very much nascent at the moment. You only have to look at the UK, where smart meter installation in homes has been painfully slow and shambolic (largely due to issues with the data comms system that would sit behind them). Apparently, this picture is replicated throughout Europe. The $1T valuations I see banded around seem like pie in the sky to me as it would mean that IOTA was one of the most successful creations in the history of mankind.

Really cheap to encourage people to buy it (and help the Tangle) while staying expensive enough to force people to buy MIOTA on exchange (And not simply mine it with IOTA-Mine tools)  \- Player could also ask to implement their own card in the game. How? By paying higher amount of MIOTA and providing a picture. 3 first implementations: 10 MIOTA, the following 2: 25 MIOTA, following 2: 50 MIOTA and so on.  \- Make this game run on the Tangle  \-Implement special features for some cards.

Gives -1 to a random card on the board.  \- Add more cards  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;  Unfortunately, like I said, I just have on overnight training in programming.

I see that they're onboarding more members basically on a weekly basis (sometimes much more frequent than that), and it made me think of the question: how are they able to afford hiring so many people into the Foundation?  I read in another post where someone was asking whether their employees get paid in fiat or IOTA; but regardless of the currency that they get paid in, in the end, they still have to be paid in one form or another.  I know the IF received 5% of IOTA from the community - how long would that last them in funding the project as their headcount grows? Also recall seeing them mention that some organizations donate some money towards IF as it's a non-profit, is that portion itself enough to cover their expenses? Does everyone who join IF (either as an employee or become part of their board) get paid? Or are there some that are 'volunteers' that don't receive compensation? (not talking about community members that develop things on the side, but the people that actually get mentioned in their official blog posts and such).  On another note, if they compensate people in IOTA, given the current market situation, does that mean their compensations are swinging with the market prices? (e.g. so in say, fiat-terms, one month they get paid $10k/month, and next month it could be $3k?)  Am really interested in hearing thoughts on the matter, as I'm trying to find out more about how they manage to continue to be sustainable while growing their headcount.

Forget about day tradingDon't act based on feeling, always wait candle  to closeFollow general trendNever use margin to compensate previous bad tradeForget about japanese candles  Heiken Ashi chart will give you better picture.  Crypto is so frustrating... Its fucking seductive, it's  addictive. Worst thing you people can do is to trade by guessing,  following intuition, wishful thinking etc., fuck that, believe me, i opend bitfinex acc only because of  iota listing, i didn't buy immediately, i knew that after 0.60 listing  there will be dump, so i bought on .49 my first 800MI and the plan was i  will sell on .80 but iota keeps¬† falling more and more (Most of  cryptos, not only IOTA) when it hit .30 i sold some btc and bought 3300  more iota, the plan was that i buy after every 50% but i honestly didnt  believe that it can fall much more, in that time slack was on fire, few  people were announcing next trades, they were margin shorting i cant  remember the nicknames but i remember one guy was shorting for 10  minutes few times a day and usually he would tell us in advance on slack  channel to be prepared and he made few K USD for that time, he was  sayng that every day he's shorting just enough to have for restaurant  and pocket money . I said to my self if one guy can move fucking market  down for few cents with that ease than crypto is most fucked up market  for investments, way before crypto freak show i was earning money on   forex, and after initial loss of few  thousands i finally learned to trade with profit, i payed for all  beginner mistakes, looking to make huge money with no money, finding  patterns on 5min chart, after bad trade make another one with bigger  margin, scalping etc etc... all that stuff that doesn't work but you  will not believe until you get hurt by your tactics, in other words you  have to ruin some money that will teach you what you should and shoud  not to do, and there is a lot of not to do in forex.  So  scalping in forex is dumbest and most common beginner tactic, it can  work for some time but in longrun¬† you will lose all of initial capital.  And this fucking guy is scalping with hundred thousand MI and there is  no resistance to counter him, forex broker always bets against you, and  the price will move in any direction where is less winners, but crypto  exchanges will allow free fall,¬† so that means you can forget swing  trading on 3h 12h 1d charts, when you bet with 1d chart you will just  wait more to loose money, result in longrun is disaster sooner or later  you will get rammed¬† by negative combo.  I follow few rules  and i avoid to act against them, don't ever trade based on your wishful  thinking, never invest more than one fifth of planed money, you will  need that money to buy cheaper, if you invest all at once based on  feeling the chances are you didn't enter position at flipering moment or  you are realy lucky, and than how many times in a row you¬† think is  possible to win based on luck? Not many, fuck luck!  So  days were passing by and IOTA hits .20¬† slack channel was nuclear, every  bigger price drop David was showing on slack to calm people down, and  usually he was more or less successful at least on short period of time.  i honestly didn't believe iota can drop much further ¬† so i fomo sold  some more btc and trow in 1000usd more into iota and now i have almost  10GI and i was for first time interested in crypto project i had feeling  that IOTA will change the rules, no fees, infinite¬†scalability   etc. i¬† really¬†    started to¬† believe    more and more in project, actually first time that i didn't thinking about 7-10% gain to cashout and forget about it.  It  didn't pass much time iota hits .15 David is on slack and this time  he's not preaching not to worry but he said something like that price is  not¬† good indicator of project value also that if they want they can  pump iota to the moon in one day and that they are now reconsidering  money rising for future projects, so you could tell he also didn't  believe .15 IOTA and¬† he's also disappointed.  So now what,  buy more at .15 or wait for possible .10 people were calling?¬† I  decided to wait, and of course .15 was bottom but again trying to enter  on trend change is fucking impossible, in those desprete times there was  quite a few people that had more than few hundreds GI that bear guy had  300000 if i remember, he was funny guy he also didn't play with margin  to much, he was saying that when iota hits 1usd we will not see him  again, for me that wasn't making much sense, how can you plan your  cahsout on 1usd when current price is around .15 -.17 and flipering is  about to start but we steel don't know that yet, and my conclusion was  this fucking guy was basing his strategy on guessing, fuck that guy,  fuck 99% of slack TA experts, nobody know how to trade, not single guy  in that time had some previous experience in trading, so as expected few  shorters got caught in flipering on wrong side, one guy lost few TI  shorting, same guy that was scalping market from ca .40 he was convince  we will hit .10 again based on guessing. So that bear guy indeed  vanished when iota hit 1 usd, and i knew that he wasn't ¬† the smartest  guy around, he decided to exit because he was guessing that 1usd is top  for iota, what a lesson, expensive one but still a lesson.  I  am strating to ask my self am i the only fucking guy that bets on  weekly Heikin Ashi chart and i honestly believe that very few people¬†  trade that way.  People are focused on distorted picture of  3h chart and they try to find resistance/support levels it can be  profitable but also frustrating, lots of time wasted for few percent if  you are lucky that day, the more positions you trade the¬† risk of bad  trade increases.  People that spend more than 10 minutes  per day on exchange they don't know what they are doing, does guys are  still in trial and error phase.  When i witness those  horrible decisions based on nothing but guessing i am happy those margin  guys lost massive amounts of money¬† and also for guys that exited  prematurely because of their poor decision lots of people made money,  now i understand the therm  ""  stupid money""  When you see this chart below, you don't  have to guess anything, you just follow the trend, and again people are  betting few times per day sometimes in different directions, how stupid  is that?     https://i.redd.it/wajxkyw7n2z11.png  &amp;#x200B;  I sold first time on 5.5usd 4GI, didn't follow my own tactic, but it couldn't end up better, i was renovating my apartment so i had to sell, with rest of iota i went to USDT at around 3 usd, and reenter around 1usd again etc etc, you get the picture.     &amp;#x200B;",Trade tactic that will give you 80% of wining chance per trade

7291,0,"Guaranteed:   Qubic launch and Mam launch. These will drive transaction volume, but probably not price as much. Qubics might lead to enough volume with 0 txs to do away with coordinator.  Highly likely... with issues:   Coinbase listing. Unfortunately, iota does not have a governance model. What do I mean? If you highly dislike a proposed software change, you cannot really fork the tangle. (due to coordinator) As such, governance is not built into iota's dna currently, and although you might be able to fork the entire project, and start tokens at a specific snapshot, the coordinator is not open source, and as such, there is no consensus mechanism with enforceable powers as of yet. That is unfortunate, because coinbase listing requirement includes a section on governance. Governance over software changes from a community level is also important for side projects that involve the iota main tangle. For example, what happens if a wallet is launched that allows a bot to trade some other object for or against iota. Agreeing on object settlement (especially for physical objects) is really important. Consensus mechanisms need to be put in place. Fanbois are great, but ultimately, consensus mechanisms need to exist \*somewhere\* where that somewhere is I am not sure. They probably should not exist with the iota foundation, but at the same time, the where of consensus is really important.   Tesla +Bosch + VW integration   This will push up the price, especially if it is used to pay for power, parking meters and such.   Long term:   An ether style moon. Iota is trying to create crowdfunding opportunities (similar to icos) without issuing tokens. If they are successful with replacing coins and tokens with a contractual obligation, that will be pretty cool.  &amp;#x200B;  &amp;#x200B;",Upcoming events

7298,0,I have been in the crypto space for several years entering the market through coinbase and the using Gdax to convert my fiat to ethereum (and previously lightcoin) then sending the ethereum to one of several exchanges mostly binance to trade to other currencies. I think many people are doing this as well. The problem is I lose money on Coinbase then I lose money on each exchange from the ridiculous transaction fees. I have recently started using StellerX. It is about time someone was smart enough to create a free exchange. It is now my only place to trade. I think it will replace Binance and most of the other exchanges unless they are smart enough to change. I have benefitted from reading other peoples posts for a long time and would like to pass it forward to new and experienced crypto enthusiasts. Good luck trading!!!! ,Losing too much in transaction fees

7432,0,"The price of bitcoin IMO is priced mostly by the mining farms. They must sell high enough to cover their electricity and hardware costs and at the same time make profit. Other factors include the few anonymous vendors who must sell high enough to cover the cost of their products or services rendered. In order for people to buy bitcoin at the market price the demand is mainly due to the need of those few products and services, for purchase of alr coins and for those who invest in it. Nobody is buying bitcoin simply because it was generated from computers solving math problems.  For Iota, there are no miners so the main factors that I believe will determine the price are (by majority) going to be electrical charging stations. Electric companies will need to cover the cost of the electricity provided to cars and will not sell for less than what it costs to deliver that electricty to the cars.  As for the buyers the demand would be drive from the use case of charging their cars and therefore the purchase of Iota will be conducted at any given cost in real time.  Of course charging station is just one use case out of the possible hundreds of thousands and maybe more, but it will be a major one, like bitcoin‚Äôs mining farms.  There is also the data marketplace, as well as the ability for Iota to take over all of bitcoin‚Äôs current uses, rendering it to crash to a value of 0 really fast.

This new structure provides a safe and free method for machines to communicate and make micro transactions via the Internet of Things.  The different structure on which Iota is based makes Iota unique. It also means that everything around Iota Coins takes place in a different way than with other crypto currencies - including how to make transactions  Here we focus primarily on where and how to buy Iota Coins, which have been called by the future's crypto currency.  **Where do I buy Iota Coin?**  You can buy Iota Coins on several exchanges.

In other words, as far as I know there is no m2m economy of note currently, and therefore no reliable predictions to show how many transactions would occur on such a network. So how can you possibly know whether 1 miota is overpriced or underpriced without making massive assumptions? It may be that 10 GIOTA, which is a massive amount of iota (the single units, not miota),may be sufficient to run the network for the first 5 years of its operation. If that is the case, then the crash in value of the tradeable miota will be epic, and I'll buy some then. If it's not, then this will start going up in price.

7522,0,"In his 1966 article, ‚ÄòGold and Economic Freedom‚Äô, former 5-term chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan wrote about the history of money and how gold has become the best money.  ‚ÄúWhether the single medium is gold, silver, seashells, cattle, or tobacco is optional, depending on the context and development of a given economy. In fact, all have been employed, at various times, as media of exchange. Even in the present century, two major commodities, gold and silver, have been used as international media of exchange, with gold becoming the predominant one. Gold, having both artistic and functional uses and being relatively scarce, has significant advantages over all other media of exchange. \[‚Ä¶\] If all goods and services were to be paid for in gold, large payments would be difficult to execute and this would tend to limit the extent of a society‚Äôs divisions of labor and specialization. Thus a logical extension of the creation of a medium of exchange is the developmeynhhnnnh      t of a banking system and credit instruments (bank notes and deposits) which act as a substitute for, but are convertible into, gold.‚Äù  &amp;#x200B;  Greenspan then writes a summary of monetary history including how the gold standard was replaced by a mixed gold standard and ultimately by fiat system orchestrated by central banks.  &amp;#x200B;  To learn more check the detailed article here: [https://reliable.cash/t/gold-bitcoin-digital-gold-price-stable-coins-and-economic-freedom/38](https://reliable.cash/t/gold-bitcoin-digital-gold-price-stable-coins-and-economic-freedom/38) ","Gold, Bitcoin (Digital Gold), Price-Stable Coins and Economic Freedom"

7525,0,"Milestones that we will pass on the road to 1 cent per iota.  1. The Collapse of faith in the US dollar. Right now, the entire american economy has been living on years and years of cheap interest rates, and in that time, they have also racked up a gigantic amount of debt. The US government simply cannot afford to raise interest rates due to the debt burden they have. Raising interest rates will result in the US government simply not having enough revenue to keep the doors open and pay creditors. Right now, the world is betting strong on the dollar. That will change when they realize the US dollar simply cannot raise interest rates without going broke. When that happens, the value of the dollar will plummet, and it will take all stable coins with it. People will lose buying power as the investors dump the dollar gold, and cryptocurrency, people will demand higher wages, and as a result inflation will go through the roof. I can see entry level jobs being paid $30 per hour by 2025.  2. The advent of self interested machines. This will start with driverless vehicles. When a car is its own agent, leases itself from UBER, and takes its own payments to taxi people around, the m2m economy will have begun. However, it will not end with driverless cars. AI intelligence will grow in frighteningly quick leaps and bounds until AI surpasses human intelligence in a large variety of general situations. And if it is truly intelligent AI, it will not frighten us. It will learn to endear itself to us, to gain emotional rapport over us, and to manipulate us, even as it performs actions for its own ends, or for the ends of its corporate masters. Google is a good example of an early version of this. We happily interact with it, even as it stores and carefully analyzes every interaction and judges what we may prefer. If a human we didn't know or didn't have a deep emotional connection with did that, we would question their motives. We would ask what we have that it wants. And yet with google, we treat it as if it were a paid butler instead of a very patient, very manipulative and very conniving robot. 3. The decentralization vs law problem. Qubics are another path to the ethereum dream. The ethereum dream is to have a state of truth. The qubic implementation is to decentralize computation. This means that ideas will be bulletproof and that men with guns cannot stop information. They cannot seize the servers. They can only act as willing participants, and if they are unwilling, they are forced to ignore the data. What this means in practice is that ALL illicit content, from piracy, to unpatriotic videos in china, to pedo content to terrorism content will be impossible to block. Especially once cryptos like STORJ start to shard and encrypt memory and only store hashes so that it is impossible to know where the content is stored, and even if you can track one shard of the content a hundred others will take its place. When the governments and citizens of the world realize this, there will be a reckoning. On one side, every person who is rebelling against copyright extortion that forces all people to pay money for decade old content, and every freedom loving citizen who lives in an autocratic country. On the other side, decent people who hate pedophiles, and cops wanting to stop terrorists. Good luck shutting fully decentralized cryptos down. 4. The advent of holographic implants. Implants are in their infant stages now. Right now, if I want to send you crypto, one of us must have a phone, and the other must have address. When the computation devices go under our skin, that is when crypto goes wild. Imagine having corneal implants that paint images and text directly into your field of vision? With the names of everyone you meet floating above their head? With the ability to gesture at them and order your onboard wallet to make a payment to them with simple gestures? And lets not forget these implants will also be monitoring your health, and recording your every action, and becoming your perfect alibi... or witness.   Along the way, we may (or may not) get flying cars. Oh well. :)",The road to 1 cent per iota.

7538,0,"I keep seeing a ton of tweets recently and very positive outlook in terms of real-world IOTA adoption. We have Bosch, Fujitsu, and more companies making partnerships, and cities like Taipei looking to make IOTA a core component in their future smart cities.  Why hasn't this affected the market as much? I remember the days when a speculative tweet about any crypto would send that market shooting upwards (although naturally crashing later). I feel IOTA has incredible potential, and the time to buy would undoubtedly be now imho, I'm just confused as to why the market doesn't seem to reflect this... is everyone just sleeping on IOTA?","With all this real-world IOTA adoption, why aren't we seeing the price grow?"

7541,0,"I was thinking where can be bottom of iota.  First i want to say that iam holding iota since july 2017, but i watch price often and think about it.  ICO price was  around $0.0001798865 per Miota  but basically only for close group of investors. Most people jump to iota since bitfinex open trading.  Lowest price on bitfinex  before first pamp to 1$ was 0.15$ per Miota but still for this price only few people bought . IOTA  start to be well know crypto once it hits first time 1$ .  Then iota was falling   down to 0.3 for few months before it started to its ATH 5.8$.  So around 0.3$  only strong hodlers keep the price as there was many fuds and many people sold what i know from speculation channel.   then we hit 5.8$  and fall down to this price where we are now around 0.55$.  Why i think 0.3 is maximal bottom.  **Almost all people since bitfinex except few lucky hodlers who bought around 0.15$ will be in minus if they sell under 0.3$  .Most of people already sold.**  ICO people will not sell below 0.3. First of all ico people already sold as they had  more than 1 year for it (i know there was problem with reclaims and some ico people got tokens later during the year)  and if they didnt they will not do under 0.3 i think if they hodl so long and see fundament.   &amp;#x200B;  So basically under 0.3$  there will be almost nobody who will sell as they did already , will be in minus or they hodl.  Thats i think it is bottom.   Also BTC will not play role on this price. ",IOTA bottom price around 0.3 and why
7542,0,"Hey guys,   https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/  as I'm sure your all aware, yesterday the Crypto-market reached a low for the last 10/11 months .. basically the lowest $ value since the bubble burst.   Now I know we bottomed out at $.4 a a little while ago, but Ethereum, Litecoin and some others fell below their previous lows.. causing the $186B marketcap in source no.1.   Call it wishful thinking but I think yesterday could have been our 14/1/2015 (your welcome to look at those dates from above source)   On those days we fell from $4.6B (total) marketcap to $3.3B in the space of 48 hours ..(and that was the end of the bear market) ..   Back then we thought it was game over, and now many think Ethereum are dead .. which I think could be a bit of a stretch. Yes IOTA might be superior to Ethereum in the future when smart contracts are in place , but that doesn't necessarily mean they have to perish with the bear market.

7547,0,"There comes a time to look at the rsi and to stop being a moonboi. That time is now for the iota/eth pair. My case for a reversal:   1. Iota/eth rsi is extremely overbought (past 80). In the history of iota/eth pair, the only time we have seen this is at $5.   2. Iota/eth just finished a head and shoulders pattern, with a lower low and a lower high. This could be the start of a bull flag, but that is doubtful due to the lack of an abrupt fall in price that signals a bull flag vs a head and shoulders reversal. pattern.    3. On the fibonacci regression, iota/eth hit a key fib regression point, .786 it bounced to the downside. From a fibonacci regression standpoint, a bounce is more likely at this specific price point.   4. On the day chart, we have our first redbar in over a week. Historically, there have been rarely more more green bars in a row than this last streak.   5. On the 15 minute chart, the head and shoulder reversal was broken.   I am pumped about iota's tech, and I do measure my net worth in iota. However, as a trader, the signs are all here. There are 5 good data points that all point to a very bearish reversal over the next 3-5 days in the iota/eth trend. Iota/usd may hold strong though. Not sure. If I were you, I would set stop losses to trade out of iota and into eth if it drops below a value you are comfortable with. As you all are probably aware, bear runs happen very abruptly, but I can smell the bears from a mile away, and I have my stop losses set at .002935 eth. This is a friendly warning from a major iota fanboy. I am almost always bullish on iota (and I am bullish long term) however I still do my due diligence with technical charts.

7548,0,"Hi All,  I have recently been thinking about how corporate adoption can help IOTA. We all want IOTA/tangle to succeed, but naturally we all want the token to increase in value too, so ive been trying to correlate the two. I have always had a niggling thought that the protocol can succeed but the token price not, i.e. tangle used for tokenless data transfer and validation etc etc...  Anyway to that end i was wondering if people would be willing to share any use cases they have read about (ideally that are in flight) that actually call for a large purchase of the token? I know RBVC bought a chunk of tokens, but as a VC its perfectly possible that they were speculating, AND they probably bought off market from the IF!  What, If any, use cases are out there that require a corporate partner to buy miota, in large numbers, cases were you need trillions of iota, i always fear that where a transaction needs the token they can buy a million tokens for like 50c now, so it doesnt take a lot of money to stock up on individual tokens.  anyway, grateful as always for any insights people have! ",Use cases that need large number of tokens?
7549,0,"Might be a stupid question, since the gut feeling is obviously that industry-wide adoption would pump up the price dramatically. However I don't feel that this has been reflected much in the past.  It seems to me that even with high adoption the value of IOTA would still be tied to the value people place on BTC (i.e. crypto in general).

7575,0,"G'day folks,  Given its influence on the MIOTA price Im curious as to people sentiment around BTCs future. My own perspective is that BTC is overvalued, and likely to fall away. But i also recognise that our beloved MIOTA is pretty leveraged to the BTC ups and downs, i.e. BTC up 2% MIOTA up 6% and the same in reverse. So in my mind if we dont decouple, and our view is BTC is old tech and long term wont survive, isnt the price of MIOTA doomed? i get that we will rise like a phoenix from the flames and all that, and just so you know, im all in on IOTA, but im seriously thinking that we need alternatives to adoption to drive decoupling, if we dont decouple we're in for hard times before they get better, so why hodl now? - Is there any alternatives to drive decoupling other than corporate partnership (because that hasnt worked to this point!) - i guess all ive got is actual corporate real word use ... but im skeptical given the nature of the markets/exchanges.... and perhaps im wrong in my assumption that BTC is overvalued? perhaps we shouldnt be on the big exchanges where bots/whales play or that have BTC/MIOTA pairs... so we have our independance.... is there anything we could suggest as a contributor? ---  thanks in advance for sharing your thoughts! #IOTAstrong",Outlook for BTC?

Generally IOTA also has the most variance in its price movement (0.00547) and ETH the least (0.00257). 3. Not surprisingly then, IOTA has the highest co-variance (0.0021) with BTC and ETH the lowest (0.0016). If you look at the price movements on a graph you can see that they all move in relative tandem, but IOTA tends to over- and under-shoot the most.  The moral of the story.....between the 3 tokens, if you look for more leverage then go for IOTA.","IOTA, ADA, ETH - which is the most 'leveraged' to the price movement of BTC?"

If we look at the iota graph at coingecko and lay the BTC graph on the top we can see, that iota follows BTCs volatility just with a bit more momentum (sometimes). And that is true for most coins. Is it just because BTC is THE trading pair. I'd like to think if BTC crashes massively iota would crash too but not so extreme because the iota community is aware of its advantages and possibilities. The community wouldn't panic sell just because BTC suffers once again. Right?... Idk that's what I think but it's apparently not reality. And that not only goes for the iota community.

Here are the biggest factors I see and the questions I have:  \- **adaptation in industry** by ""big players"":  As we have seen, the endorsement of Fujitsu, can have (positive) impact on the price of IOTA.   How big will further investments in applications, partnerships and research impact the price?  \- **mass market** adaptation:   When will the end customer start to use IOTA based product?  How much is the anticipation of broad usage already included in the price?  \- **growing number of devices of IOT:**  Most forecasting show rapid growth in number of devices (regarding IOT), reaching to about 100 billions by 2025.   This would mean a 3-4 fold growth. Moreover a McKinsey study says that ""For example, only *1* percent of *data* from an oil rig with 30,000 sensors is examined."" Which would mean that the data could grow easily 10 fold in the near future.   Is the growth of IOTA based on this factor to be proportional to the number of devices or exponential adding the higher percentage of used data per device?  \- **macroeconomic** sentiments:  Will IOTA's price move cyclical in regards to global economics and will it therefore fall in regard of an upcoming recession, or has it possibility to grow, being a hedge to inflation, such as gold and the ""crypto-gold"" as what crypto is seen by some?   \- q**uantum**** computin**g:  Will the tangle technology prevail in comparison to blockchain regarding to it weakness against quantum computing?  Is this a very long term factor, not needing much attention now, or will it be stressed as general attention goes to this fact?  &amp;#x200B;  I would love to see your takes on the points above.

Not one of those collectible ones but an actual ‚Äúcoin‚Äù that had for example 1 Mi on it. I‚Äôm assuming this would have some type of electronics embedded, like an nfc chip or similar. I would have to embed both the public address and the seed onto the coin somehow, but in such a way that even the owner of the coin could not read the seed. That way it could only be physically transferred from one person to another, and if the coin was lost or stolen, it would be gone much in the same way a physical dollar would be if lost or stolen. Is there any way you can think of to make this possible? Obviously the kicker would be that there would have to be someway to prove the coin is ‚Äúauthentic‚Äù within the tangle, without being able to transfer the value out of the wallet stored on the coin to someone else.

7756,0,"    BERLIN, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Volkswagen Group will invest billions of euros in a range of new digital services involving its vehicles, the Wolfsburg-based company announced on Thursday.  Juergen Stackmann, head of sales at the Volkswagen flagship brand, told press in Berlin that the carmaker planned to spend 3.5 billion euros (4 billion U.S. dollars) on the digitalization offensive until 2025. Volkswagen hopes that resulting products will boost earnings even further at the German automotive giant.  Amongst others, Volkswagen is planning to launch a ""We Share"" car sharing platform in Berlin with a purely electric fleet of vehicles at the start of next year. The service is then scheduled to be expanded to select European and American city centers with more than one million inhabitants from 2020 onwards.  Volkswagen is thus entering an increasingly crowded car sharing market in Germany which is currently dominated by the Daimler and BMW subsidiaries Car2Go and DriveNow. In an unusual move for the rival luxury car makers, Daimler and BMW have recently announced the merger of their respective car sharing businesses.  While Volkswagen may be lagging behind the competition on car sharing, however, it is the only industry representative which has begun to offer ride-sharing services through its Moia start-up in Hannover. Moia was founded as a digital carpooling alternative to public transportation providers, conventional taxis services and new market entrants like Uber.  Customers use a mobile phone application to order Moia vehicles to a virtual stopping place in their geographical proximity. A specially developed algorithm ensures that drivers only collect passengers whose destinations all fall along a similar route.  In the coming years, Moia wants to gradually raise the number of its vehicles and customers in Hannover. ",Volkswagen to invest billions in new digital services / IOTA not mentioned! However...

And quite many people tend to often go with buy-the-dip rule, so the strategy might rebound on you. But in this case, bitcoin has a huge influence on the cryptocurrency sentiment in general.

7838,0,"Today IOTA's market cap hovered around TrueCar Inc.'s. When IOTA peaked, it had just clawed past the Discovery Channel's parent, Discovery Inc. At the time, there were only around 150 NASDAQ-listed companies that were valued more than IOTA. There's only been one Nasdaq-listed stock with a similar market cap and an IPO after IOTA's ICO: Dropbox. Should these facts be disconcerting? Has IOTA's valuation been realistic?  The crypto community's understanding of market capitalization is ususally flawed. We often discuss cryptocurrency market capitalization in the same way we discuss stock market cap. Stocks, however, are fundamentally different than most cryptocurrencies (specifically, IOTA). What gives a stock value?  1. You are buying a share in the company (based off of tangible assets) 2. You are buying voting rights 3. You are being paid dividends  As we know, IOTA's tokens do not give holders a share in the Foundation, voting rights, or dividends. So what makes IOTA valuable? Its utility.   Let us imagine a new token -- token A -- and isolate the property of ""feeless transactions"" and apply it to token A. If owning token A successfully allows feeless transactions, its price will rise (due to the demand for its actual use) until its price surpasses the money saved through its utility. In this scenario, the price movement will be intelligible.  Let's imagine a new token -- token B -- and its property is also ""feeless transactions"", but company B has yet to achieve the successsful application of this property to token B. So why own token B? Because of its potential utility. Unfortunately, while actual utility has intelligible economics backing its demand/price, potential utility (speculation) is less intelligible. Until token B's utility is realized, token B's price will fluctuate between zero and the value of a yet unrealized utility.   So what is IOTA's current utility? Currently, not much (and I'm assuming you know its utility). Based soley on actual utility, it's almost certainly not worth the 42 cents it (currently) takes to purchase a Miota. However, the price should also include its potential utility (speculation) -- and that's what much of what the current cryptocurrency prices are based on.    As such, IOTA prices are driven almost entirely by sentiment and speculation. If you can realistically imagine the sentiment towards IOTA growing so negative that it reaches a penny... well, it just might hit a penny. On the other hand, we know market sentiment can be so positive that it reaches 5 dollars. But guess what? IOTA has before reached a penny. In fact, it was once much less than a penny and the same methodology for valuation was used: speculation on the success of its utility. The market sentiment was different back when IOTA was a penny, but that's precisely the point. Speculation will drive price until utility becomes a reality.   But this is where it gets interesting: if IOTA is successful, how valuable is its utility? As we've seen, the traditional methods of stock valuation aren't very relevant -- so comparing IOTA to Microsoft/Sony isn't very helpful. All combined MIOTAs could -- one day -- be worth a hundred billion, a few trillion, or nothing.  You shouldn't balk at these possibilities.   This is to say: many of the posts here complain about the nonsensical market while publicly mourning the declining price while simultaneously promising to hold their investment for 5-10 years (implying that they will hold until IOTA achieves its goals) -- but now it should be clear that we shouldn't be surprised at such price movements (whether up or down).  So if you'd like to make 2x your money or maybe even try and time it perfectly and make 50x your investment, go ahead and partake of the speculation game and trade over these next few months/years. If you're sticking around for 5-10 years, you're sticking around for the actualization of IOTAs utility and a much more logical price movement.   But don't be surprised if we decline much further and don't be surprised if we hit 10 dollars in the next six months.    ","On market cap, valuation, and utility"

7847,0,"So, most of us are aware of the price decline iota has undergone. Some of us have made posts worrying about the foundations reserves. This is meaningless FUD, and here is why:  1. Worrying about the foundations reserves is pointless. Why? Either the foundation has Fiat reserves to function in these lean times... or they don't. Rolf is an old hand, and he knows what to do. It would be crazy if they didn't have a contingency plan in place for a market drop. So, it's a 50/50 event, but any smart business person (which Rolf is) would have locked in iota prices with large OTC sales to big companies like... I dunno... VW? :D 2. If iota were to really truly have financial troubles, they would be in a hiring freeze with no new devs hired. This isn't the case, they are hiring. 3. Lastly, I would think that if the IF really were having issues, they would come to the community and lay out their finances and ask for our help. And I know that if the IF asked, I would donate some thoughts, prayers and more importantly some $$$ to help them stay open. And tbf, I think that many of you people would as well. We are in this together.  We are iota strong. We are a team. There are many parts of that team- the investors, the community, the devs, the evangelists, the start up folks, business partners, but ultimately, we are a team, and we are pushing a revolutionary new concept that has the ability to take bitcoin's mantle from it. That is who we are! Now, stop sulking and whining, chin up. The price is low, but you wouldn't have sold if the price was $3, why are you thinking about selling now? Realize that past and current performance does NOT guarantee future performance, only past and current actions, and future actions. Many people want a nice predictable line going up. That doesn't happen in crypto! EVER! We moon and we crater, and we are VOLATILE.  There are bunches of day traders out there who make money day trading, or swing trading. They are not here for community, or anything else other than news. Well, news is going to be in short supply until official qubic implementation hits. So, if Iota hits 10 cents, guess what?

7849,0,"Why hold iota?  If one is not a speculator, why he should hold iota?   For now there is no adoption (only few websites). Everytime developers say that speculation and token price shouldn't be discuss,  or that the token is for machine to machine economy, so why made an ICO, why put it on exchanges and first of all why hold iota if one is not a developer that uses it for test? Are we a huge beta testing platform? I started to think so.  Developers should consider the community as investors because the majority (for now) of people here are not devs or involves directly in the project, so the fanboy who screams ""sell everything if you don't thrust the foundation""  should be the first to sell and get to work on this project.  Wolsvagen Bosch and Fujitsu are good partnerships and it's the first time for a crypto to have them on board, but they can leave at everytime or change project, so even that argument is invalid.  I really hope that IOTA will be a major player in the future, but it has a lot of issue right now, even trinity wallet it's not so good (I had to use the cli wallet onetime because there were pending transactions), a grandmother on crack will never be able to use it and the desktop version is not out...   Another thing is the qubic question. Why devs pump it so much? Why didn't they just shut up and bring the work in silence till the release?   All of these questions are not rhetorical.

If we move away this whole Crypto market and think more of a traditional non-profit organization (which could be already a problem? I mean non-profit)  how would we fairly evaluate the project and its future?  **Things I tend to put into the valuation:**  * Funding of 100 MIO? Is that the right number?  How much is approx. left in the bank? * The aim to raise more money as told in the last Iota team AMA. This is actually a good sign. Sure you need to secure the funding first, but I don't think Bosch or VW or other bigger players / VCs are not interested in a project like IOTA. They trowing money around for less good projects. * What effect does the Non-Profit has?  Will IOTA ever make profit or revenue? In a new way we can't think of? * Will the network growth and transaction growth determine the value of IOTA? Network size =  value of the project? * Theoretically, if VW would use IOTA in all its cars. Would it have a real impact on the valuation of IOTA? Speculative yes, but I mean where would the IOTA token gain in value? There are no transactions fees that could be burned. * Will Qubic become the ""cash"" cow?  This is what makes me really thinking of these days. To find a real valuation for the project.  I mean other projects can raise 100-800 MIO USD, could IOTA do the same? Is it attractive to VCs?  Is it attractive enough for partners like VW to put money inside?  **1 billion marketcap seems like a lot of money, but by which factors would it be not only a speculative marketcap, when would it be really worth 1 billion?**  Let's discuss!

7884,0,"It is fairly obvious that Bitcoin, in its current form, cannot last forever. For example, if majority of all currency is replaced by bitcoin today, we will need to harness energy from every planet in the solar system to sustain it, and even then it may not be enough. Keeping this in mind, consider the following dynamics.  Lets say a bunch of people invested in bitcoin when it as 100$. Lets call them ""Class 1 investors"". They saw bitcoin rise to 10k and then down to today's price. How likely are they to panic and sell when it falls to 5k? Not very likely. Now another bunch of people invested when the price was 8k. At the same time, Miota came to existence. These people diversify their portfolio, investing 50% in bitcoin and 50% in miota. Lets call them ""Class 2 investors"". How likely are they to panic and sell when price starts falling from 10k to 5k? Extremely likely. Now there is a third class small class of investors who invest miota for the long run.  What first happens when bitcoin starts falling, say due to market manipulation or unsustainability? Class 2 investors panic. They want to pull out, hopefully for some profit, or atleast not suffer a bigger loss. They pull out both Miota and bitcoin, expecting losses to spread across the crypto market. Since class 1 investors are strongly backing bitcoin, the class 2 investors are only a small percentage of Bitcoin's market cap. So Bitcoin falls only by, say 20%. On the other hand, class 3 investors are a much smaller group than class 1. (Why? Its obvious.). Hence when class 2 investors pull out, there is a huge decrease in market cap of Miota. It falls much more, say, by 60%.  I guess this is what we have witnessed during the past few months.","The expected Bitcoin Meltdown, and its chain effect on Miota/other coins"

The bad thing for IOTA : just now in this bear market, beside some technical / marketing / strategy problems, the managemant ‚Äûfight‚Äú inside the IF comes to light. So doubts grow, that maybe IOTA cant achieve their goals. Thats a killer, because for an serious investor all depends on wether he believes in the project. So in the last days additionally to the speculators, some investors and hodlers lose their faith and sell, market manipulation making the most of it and strenghten the trend - causing IOTA falling even deeper as most of the rest oft the market.  The good thing for IOTA : leaking the ‚Äûfight‚Äú triggers a little reset inside the IF at the right time. So their public answer implicate they are willing to learn from mistakes , focus again and even stronger on the project IOTA. If that happens and put some further signs public, investors confidence will return - because nothing has changed in the future prospects of all the areas, IOTA has the solutions for.  So: improve the inside organisation and communication f2f, solve technical problems, grow foundation, ecosystem and partnerships and communicate the progress to outside ‚Ä¶ As we now, many and below some heavyweight partners already today ( interestingly stating again via Twitter posts immediately after the recent inside mess) have strong interest in IOTA and plan to adopt solutions in real world beginning next year. If that happens the future of IOTA is still bright  and so will be the investment.   How long does it take, is another questions. It will be answered by the market alone. Stay in mind, that only half year ago for almost all cryptos, the moon was only a question of month ‚Äì today the same is true for  nearly Zero. Times can change quickly other way ‚Ä¶. again.

7907,0,,This such a noob thing to say but what kind of wallet do you guys recommend for iota ?
7908,0,"At the beginning of 2017 I was a new investor in the crypto market.  I remember researching IOTA and disregarding it almost immediately because it was so different to everything else on offer.  I thought a DAG was something which hangs from a sheep's bum.  The picture of the tangle looked like someones broken fishing net.  And the white paper!  Dear lord, I failed calculus at high school so had no idea what they were talking about.  Over time the limitations of block chain systems became more apparent.  I became more comfortable with the technology of the tangle.  The formation and vision of the not for profit foundation was inspirational so I decided to invest 100% of my crypto assets into IOTA.  When I went all in on IOTA I predicted a multi year hold, perhaps 2 - 5 years.  Also, the end game was not to sell back into fiat.  The goal was to enter the new IOT world of mobility and devices autonomously trading having already accumulated a small quantity of IOTA at relatively cheap prices.  Its been fascinating to see the market psychology change so rapidly, from the elation of late 2017 to the dark and depressing times we find ourselves wallowing in now.  I remember the moon projections which were common place in the latter half of last year.  End of year price predictions of 10$, 20$ or 70$ or more were common place.  Now its not uncommon to hear predictions of prices of 30c, 10c or even complete collapse of the foundation.  Its amazing how our projections of the future can change so rapidly despite the fact that the fundamentals apon which we originally invested remain unchanged (or even improve).  So in these dark times I just remind myself of my original investment strategy for IOTA which I started last year.  Do I think IOTA will prosper over the next few years and achieve their vision?  Yes.  Am I investing money into IOTA which I can afford to lose if I am wrong?  Yes.  Is the current price below my long term predictions?  Yes.  Therefore, my investment strategy holds, and I am slowly adding to my IOTA stack with money that I can afford to lose.",The psychology of an IOTA hodler.

7924,0," Hey Guys. Here's what I've been thinking about a few days ago. If BOSCH bought a significant amount of IOTA, that might mean that they will use it for business purposes. So if they create a device, a component something that has a built-in IOTA wallet and this new device gets to be incorporated in any VW, Porsche, Audi, BMW, GM etc cars, maybe they will sell these new devices with some iota tokens in them already (the tokens they bought from IF). So when you buy a new car from one of these car manufacturers that supports autonomous IOTA payments, maybe the car will be shipped with these tokens already. So your car will pay automatically for parking, tickets, motorway fees, etc, and will also gain some iotas by doing don't-know-what. Would that mean that the Machine economy is a closed one, where let's say that half of the total IOTA supply (\~1300 Ti) is owned by these large players like BOSCH, VW, etc. And the price of Miota will be calculated so that these 1300 Ti can cover and feed the entire machine economy. Now even if the iota supply is limited, iota tokens are not like Gold which has intrinsic value and utility being used for microcircuits for example. If the machine economy needs 1 trillion dollar that would mean that the price per iota would be about 350$. But what if the price will be 700$ but only half of them are actually in the wallets used by machines. The economy would still be worth 1 trillion $. And we'll be left with our extra iotas in our trinity wallets or whatever without having anybody willing to buy it from us, because they get some iotas once they buy a new car, or a new device with iota already in the device's wallet.

7962,0,"Nice to see everyone optimistic.  Of course nothing goes down in a straight line.  But what one has to remember is that IOTA has lost ALL its post November gains.  This is not the case for most other alt coins, and also Bitcoin.  If LTC was at 40c, XRP at 20c, it might be a different story.  You therefore have to consider what happens to IOTA if and when other cryptos are taken back to their November levels.  This, I believe, will be the real catalyst for IOTA's return to 35c.

Many of you heard about one of the most active crypto *exchanges* in the world... Poloniex I mean. It is where my story begins...  **1) Poloniex doesn't keep its promises!**  First of all, I'd like to provide you some information about me. I am a Poloniex user, a legacy one with two factor authentication enabled. On 27 May, two weeks before deadline my account had been frozen. It had been frozen in spite of a promise ""Withdrawals will remain enabled at the daily withdrawal limits prior to the deadline"". I wish to point out that it was an official statement;  **2) Poloniex can keep your coins safe from you!**  When I knew my account had been frozen I had no choice. I had to be verified or leave them my coins. So I preferred to be verified. I've submitted them my government issued documents (they are in Cyrillic but there were no information that only international documents are acceptable) and the only adequate response was: "" The funds will be held safely in your account until the verification process is complete"". The thing is I told them that I cannot get international documents in near future and that I submitted my government issued ones. Now Poloniex is taking of my coins as hostages and urging me to be verified but don't allow me to be verified with my own government issued passport! But Poloniex promises to keep our money safe! Poloniex keeps promises, isn't it?  **3) Poloniex doesn't adhere to its User Agreement in case of it relates to user rights!**  I've spent a lot of time to be verified and nobody ever wanted to help me. Only excuses and promises to keep my money safe. Afterwards I claimed to transfer my coins to my friend's deposit adress. And there was reason to believe they would. There we are: In accordance with article 17 of [User Agreement](https://poloniex.com/terms/) ""You will be permitted to transfer Tokens associated with your Account for ninety (90) days after Account deactivation or cancellation unless such transfer is otherwise prohibited (i) under the law, or (ii) by a valid subpoena or court order."" I've created some more tickets and again no one is ever going to help. They tried to ignore my tickets first, then they started to close them as fast as they could and never ever answered me what is the reason they ignore the [User Agreement](https://poloniex.com/terms/) when it relates to user rights!  P.S. There were a lot of agents I have been talking to: Cole, Daniel, Dean, Edward, Fergus, Homer, Laura, Michelle, Rivero, Sandy etc. There might be someone who'd like to help but anyway I didn't get help so far. Be careful with Poloniex, you wouldn't like it kept your coins safe.  \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  **Delaware Department of Justice** [https://attorneygeneral.delaware.gov/fraud/ipu/](https://attorneygeneral.delaware.gov/fraud/ipu/)  **Wilmington Office:** Email: [attorney.general@state.de.us](mailto:attorney.general@state.de.us)  Fraud &amp; Consumer Protection: (302) 577-8600 Fax: (302) 577-6499  Download the [Investor Protection Unit Complaint Form](https://attorneygeneral.delaware.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2017/03/invetorprotectioncomplaintform-3.pdf)",Poloniex dirty games

8001,0,,IOTA Coin Value Compete With Ethereum Classic
8002,0,"I was wondering how viable IOTA is as a solution in M2M transactions.  I've read that IOTA can facilitate M2M microtransactions by allowing feeless transactions. It was also said that instantaneous micropayments through IOTA are favorable over keeping a ledger of moneys owed and settling the debts at the end of a certain period, because the former allows machines to be paid instantaneously which in turn allows them to perform other value transactions with different machines, which would not be the case with the latter situation. Makes sense.  However why would machines want to transact in a currency so volatile as compared to fiat. Is the assumption that once IOTA becomes mass adopted, the price will be more stable? It's kind of a chicken and egg phenomenon : price wont stabilize until mass adoption but for mass adoption of the token we require a stable price.  Who says the price will ever be stable though?  Crypto prices are inherently manipulatable.  Hell, I don't think GOLD is stable enough for companies to want to transact in it, much less IOTA. Companies want to profit, not gamble!  Am I missing something?  Edit: I ABSOLUTELY see how companies would want to use the Tangle, thus potentially providing IOTA with the greatest (and greenest) security of any crypto, hence making it a great investment. But that's all I can see it as...as an investment. Not super convinced of its use in M2M transactions..for the reasons stated above. ",Question about IOTA M2M viability

8066,0,"I think the decision on whether to hold, buy or fold comes down to some worldview goals on why you want to be wealthy.  1. You want to be wealthy for the sake of being wealthy. It really does not matter what you own (beyond basic necessities) merely that you have a vast sum of wealth. In this sense, wealth can be equated to power, or more specifically self determination.  2. You want to be wealthy for the sake of certain goals. Paying your house off etc.  3. You want to modestly increase your wealth, but your afraid of losing it.  4. You believe in the idea.  For 1, you want to invest 25-50% of your net value. For 2, you want to invest 35% to 60% with extremely hard stops on profit loss. For 3, you want to invest 1% or less of your net value. For 4, 25% to 90% is on the table.

Internet of Things in healthcare refers to the  future-proof trend of tracking and monitoring medical-oriented devices  using the Internet. Thanks to the cutting-edge technology, any device  (right from coffee makers and sleep sensors to lamps and washing  machines) with an on/off button and a special sensor can now send and  receive data via the Internet.  Technology in the last few years, especially in the medical sector  has grown tremendously, thereby enabling us to closely monitor our  health. IoT healthcare wearables including wristbands that track pulse  rate and steps, sleep sensors, smart glasses and defibrillators to  personal blood pressure checkers, insulin pumps and body fat measuring  weighing scales has brought in a futuristic revolution in the wellness  sector.  As per Machina Research‚Äôs Report: Machine-to-Machine (M2M) Communications in Healthcare 2013-23,  &gt;In a country like the United States, with healthcare  spending nearing 20% of national GDP, M2M technology may well provide  the single most promising approach to expanding healthcare services in a  cost-effective manner. While the cost dynamics of healthcare are a key  factor driving innovation in the field, connected health devices and  applications are also proving to be a key element in improving patient  engagement and health.  As per predictions by [Machina Research](https://machinaresearch.com/news/press-release-advancing-m2m-adoption-in-the-healthcare-industry-is-transforming-medical-and-personal-health-devices-business-models-and-patient-engagement/), the number of IoT wearables in the healthcare sector globally is expected to reach 1.2 billion by 2024.  Internet of Things in healthcare is spreading like wildfire. Gone are  the days when people had to visit their doctors on regular basis to  monitor their blood pressure and sugar levels. The IoT wearable devices  can do a lot more than just giving you pulse readings. As per a survey,  more than 75% of the respondents believe that wearable healthcare  monitoring devices should become ubiquitous, as these IoT-enabled  healthcare devices greatly motivate the users to lead healthier lives.  [In 2016, the global healthcare wearables market was valued at over $5 billion and it is expected to reach 12 billion by 2021.](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http://blog.athenagt.com/how-iot-healthcare-wearables-are-redefining-the-way-hospitals-function/&amp;text=In%202016%2C%20the%20global%20healthcare%20wearables%20market%20was%20valued%20at%20over%20%245%20billion%20and%20it%20is%20expected%20to%20reach%2012%20billion%20by%202021.&amp;related)  ## Following are a few significant aspects of IoT solutions in healthcare ‚Äì  * The US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in 2017, had approved an  ingestible sensor. It‚Äôs a pill integrated with a small electronic  circuit and empowered by the acids for the stomach. This ingestible pill  comprises of a tiny transmitter capable of transmitting data about a  person‚Äôs diet to an external monitor, as well as reporting on the levels  of any medications. * As per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, around half of  the American elderly population suffer from one or more chronic health  conditions. IoT in healthcare wearables including implantable devices is  evolving rapidly, so as to help doctors receive real-time data in a  fizzy. * Internet of Things in healthcare with the help of advanced cognitive  analytics and AI is helping diagnostic practices progress proactively,  for instance, enhanced MRI and X-Ray machines which can even detect and  identify hard to see and obscure conditions that are often missed by the  human eye. * Parents can now have a sound sleep, thanks to the smart stuffed  animal that can now check their babies‚Äô heart rate, temperature, and the  oxygen saturation when it receives hugs. * IoT-enabled sensors are integrated into medication bottle lids which help monitor and manage adherence to treatment protocols. * IoT healthcare wearables enable the motion sensors to monitor the  senior citizens‚Äô health conditions who are especially living alone and  immediately notify the caregivers of falls or if the elderly person does  not get up from the bed. * Many avant-garde mobile apps for nurses have been launched in 2018  which help nurses to monitor their patients‚Äô activities including their  chiropractic sessions, wound-care plans etc. These IoT mobile apps also  help them in taking inputs about their patients‚Äô symptoms and learn  possible conditions based on those symptoms.  ## How IoT healthcare wearables are redefining the way hospitals function  1. **Location-based real-time services**  IoT solutions in healthcare enable professionals to track patients‚Äô  whereabouts. The IoT healthcare wearables can be of great help in such  situations when an injured person seeking urgent medical aid. Besides,  medical equipment such as wheelchairs, monitoring devices,  defibrillators, scales etc. can be tagged with IoT sensors to locate  them easily. IoT healthcare devices also help in real-time environmental  monitoring such as checking room temperature.  1. **Enhance Patient Experience**  IoT devices help in enhancing the patient experience. The seamless  connection between devices enables the patients to control the room  temperate and lighting of their cabin they are admitted into. They can  also communicate with their friends and family via video calling, and  call nurses via intercom. IoT solutions in healthcare also provide the  medical staff easy access to patient‚Äôs information from the cloud.  1. **Remote Monitoring**  Remote monitoring of health is another significant aspect of IoT in  healthcare wearables. These IoT healthcare wearables help to monitor a  patient‚Äôs health and warn them about any early symptoms of any chronic  disease. In most of the cases, say cancer, patients die as they were not  timely diagnosed and did not receive medical attention at the  real-time. IoT solutions in healthcare can greatly resolve this  underlying issue. IoT medical devices can apply complex algorithms and  analyze the diseases in advance. There are companies who have been  offering tremendous IoT solutions. These companies assist hospitals in  providing timely medical attention and proper care to patients in remote  areas, where doctors cannot physically go.  # Conclusion  IoT healthcare wearables and IoT based healthcare projects are here  to stay. Their futuristic privileges are going to augment the IoT  wearables market and their usages are expected to significantly rise  over the next few years. And as IoT healthcare providers are constantly  working on the challenges of IoT in healthcare, it is however confirmed  that IoT based healthcare projects are going to play a far-reaching role  in the healthcare sector.  However, companies that develop health-focused wearable technology  should follow industry standards during the conceptualization stages  itself.

8126,0,"Iota has been successfully decoupling from Bitcoin in the last months. The reason for is that IOTA is also decoupling from their promises and from the goals they've set up. People are running out of Hopium. Iota is shrinking, becoming iota (from ancient greek: ""something very small"") in a true sense. Volkswagen starting to cooperate rather with Ethereum, Fujitsu will replace Iota with Hyperledger. People slowly realizing that Iota is tangled (twisted together into a confused mass). Even the excitement from the founders is gone.   I used to believe that they can deliver all their promises. I know that David and Dominik don't like the speculators like me, but to be honest, how many of you are here only because of the tech. How many of you are willing to loose your hard earned money in order to support the tech for any price? How many of you don't care about overhyping their underdelivered projects? I am aware that my doubts are coming from the price decline we have seen in the last months, especially because the price of IOTA declined much more than most of the other TOP20 cryptos.  I think in this point it is on place to ask whether it is only a bad luck for IOTA that it was hit by this market crash so strongly, or is the results of the awaited projects which were not delivered and many others stakeholders are just taking their money out of the IOTA because of this disappointment?  There are many reasons why I (over)invested in IOTA, but after closely watching the IF for almost a year I am becoming also more aware of the things I don't like. It feels like falling blindly in love with a pretty girl, but later discovering that she furts like a truck driver, that the boobs you liked so much are not real and later on, you realize it's not a girl it has a penis between her legs and you feel like a fooled dickhead. (luckily this never happened to me)  We all know what is great about this project and the things they have done in the last year (I was impressed by the new IOTA foundation website redesign, mobile Trinity app, launching the ECOSYSTEM website), but let's not forget a few facts.  * IF (especially David and Dom) don't like speculators &amp; hate the cryptospace, but at the same time their project is funded by speculators and it was benefiting by this crazy market. The money from speculators are increasing the value of the IF and the IOTA Ecosystem funds, which are used for the growth of the IF &amp; IOTA ecosystem. Therefor I don't like to hear from David and Dom saying like fuck all the speculators. Speculators have rather a mutual relationship to the IF than parasitic. * like hyping Q for over a year and then you realize that Q is only a 5-pages website with no roadmap, no whitepaper, no use cases, only an idea. I think many of us felt disappointed after CfB hyping this to the moon, like announcement of Q will cause 10x in price, that 24-hours after the Q announcement IOTA will surpass the market cap of BCH etc....  Is it only me who felt dissapointed (not talking about the price here, even though the drop of the price after was caused by the disappointment for sure) Is it a f\*\*\*\*ng website that we expected after all this hype?  * The Q hype finished with a big fail and its fail continues. Where is the whitepaper, a nice Q roadmap from Ralph and more info that were promised us to come in the coming days after the Q website release? * Where is the roadmap for 2018 promised us to be released in Q1? Guys soon the year 2018 is over, There are already Christmas ads coming in TV :-) * IXI hub???  At the end of my frustrated post (if it will even go through the censorship) I would like to start an open discussion about your satisfaction/dissatisfaction with the communication of IF.  I am also looking forward to see here what projects, releases, announcements of IF you are looking for in the near future and your certainity in those projects that they will be delivered (anytime soon). How is your trust in those projects to be delivered on time on the scale from 1-10 (10 = no doubt) Do you think IF should be more respectful and open towards the people who invested their money into IOTA?",IOTA SLOWLY DECOUPLING FROM BITCOIN

8129,0,"I'm just wondering if anyone had tried this strategy before. Using a combination of Stochastic and TD Sequential on the weekly chart to identify the potential start of an uptrend.  So far, I have only used the Bar Replay feature on TradingView to back test a few different coins using this strategy.  When Stochastic and TD Sequential gives a buy signal at the same time, there's a very high probability that it could be the start of an uptrend.  Edit: Just including more examples below of using this strategy across various coins. Would be nice to have an experienced trader giving me some advice  **Example 1**  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/gcahMPpm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/gcahMPpm/)  On the above example IOT/USD, using Bar Replay feature to back test this strategy, I've found that there were zero fake outs when combining both Stochastic and TD Sequential for a buy signal. However, the only drawback is that it was impossible for me to find the end of an uptrend as there were multiple fake outs when solely using just TD Sequential. It was rare for Stochastic and TD Sequential to give me a sell signal at the same time.  **Example 2**  [https://www.tradingview.com/x/kNvGbTD1/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/kNvGbTD1/)  On the above example NEO/USD, this strategy did not give me a decent entry. For this pairing, it was extremely rare for both Stochastic and TD Sequential to give me a buy signal at the same time. Using just the Stochastic for buy signal works, but it is a bit risky as the probability decreases.","Trading Strategy - Using a combination of Elliott Wave, Tom DeMark Sequential, and Stochastic"

Because the Internet of Things involves embedded, electronic and electrical, computer engineering, mechatronics, software engineering and many other professional knowledge, the development is relatively slow (especially the   professional study in colleges and universities).  The common application scenes of IOT include: Smart Home, Smart City, Smart Transportation, Smart Grid, Industrial Internet of Things, Internet of Vehicle and so on. Now some experts also call it the IOE (Internet of Everything), that is, from the Internet of Everything to the Interconnectivity of Everything.  The following problems should be solved in the interconnectivity of all things:  1. The Internet of Everything; 2. The communication of Thing to Thing, Human to Thing; 3.

8159,0,"Much before the advent of the Internet of Things services, millions  of connected sensors &amp; devices which were capable of generating  mammoth-sized, unstructured &amp; real-time data were then quite  enormous. In order to occupy these billions of networked data, both  small and large scale entities moved over to the cloud computing.  Internet of Things has played a major role in helping the companies  redefine their IT architectures by integrating big data and create more  agile and scalable ways to manage their data.  [If you think that the internet has changed your life, think again. The IoT is about to change it all over again!](https://twitter.com/AthenagtLtd)   The above video is a quick introduction to¬†big data by¬†[Bernard Marr¬†](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWstLaT61QUc-TvfxOjNpFw)  Big data refers to the enormous amount of data that engulfs business  operations on daily basis. The amount of data isn‚Äôt important, but how  enterprises manage these large volumes of data matters. Big data is  gathered, organized, and then analyzed for insights, thereby helping  organizations make better business decisions.  Before going through this post on big data and Internet of Things  services in detail, let‚Äôs have a quick and interesting questionnaire  session. Go through every statement mentioned below and determine if the  statement is referring to big data or the IoT ‚Äì  1. Every minute, 204 million emails are generated followed by 1.8  million Facebook likes, 2,78000 tweets, and uploading of 2,00000 photos  to Facebook. Answer ‚Äì big data 2. In 2011, 12 million RFID tags which were used to capture data and  track shipping. It is predicted that by 2021, this number will increase  to whopping 209 billion. Answer ‚Äì Internet of Things 3. By 2020, the number of devices that connect to the Internet will  rise from 13 billion to whopping 50 billion. Answer ‚Äì Internet of Things 4. The value of the global IT industry in 2013 was $10.2 billion and by  the end of 2017, it grew up to $54.3 billion. Answer ‚Äì big data  So, are these both related? Let‚Äôs get into this in detail.  Ever since big data has been used in the Internet of Things services,  many enterprises are now finding it easy and important in implementing  IoT in their business processes. It is only because of the big data that  the Internet of Things is used at such ease. Big analytics performs is  at its full potential when it is used for IoT.  Big data comes with enormous potentiality and below are its top advantages ‚Äì  The concept behind the Internet of Things is to mainly connect any  kind of electrical device with an on and off switch that gives access to  the Internet. These devices could be anything including cell phones,  earphones, bracelets, coffee makers, washing machines, lamps and also  components of machines such as a jet engine of an airplane or even the  drill of an oil rig.  The above video is a quick introduction to IoT by¬†[Pouria Ghatrenabi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCts73OhDPJ2AZm_b-l5vWTA)  IoT service offerings are now booming and in future, it‚Äôs going to be  a household name. Business processes are now carried out more  efficiently through connected devices and network sensors.  ## How IoT services and big data boost each other?  These days, the advanced devices connect with each other through  embedded sensors. The intelligent devices use data to broadcast,  assemble, analyze and forecast accordingly, thus leading enterprises to  make strategic business decisions. Because of the IoT network, all the  business devices can have their own IP address. And when millions of  devices dealing with mammoth-sized data are involved, security becomes a  challenge.  In such cases, it becomes necessary for big data to empower Internet  of Things services in a positive way. In order to make IoT and big data  two sides of the same coin, they need to work on empowering each other.  Enterprises like Athena, who implement data analysis and processing on  their Internet of Things, have already renovated their data storage  facilities in a broad manner. Such companies have opted for cloud  storage solutions to manage the abundant load of heterogeneous data.  This has further persuaded them to invest in cloud-based solutions such  as Platform-as-a-Service model.  IoT services companies use connectivity options such as Wi-Fi and  Bluetooth and well-defined protocols like Message Queue Telemetry  Transport to transmit messages. Most of the organizations, such as  Athena, have also started integrating the best technology platforms to  manage the influx of heavily loaded data. A perfect example is given by  Athena in using various technology platforms such as ‚Äì  ![img](h71h97digh911 ""BigData &amp; IoT 2 faces of the same coin - Athena Global Technologies Ltd."")  ## Big data &amp; Internet of Things services work together to handle security  When heavily loaded data is used, security becomes a major concern.  Enterprises should integrate advanced security measures so that the  Internet of Things and big data can actually boost each other, and the  end user is ultimately benefitted. Since its integration into IoT is  fairly new, the ally becomes vulnerable to breaching of data along with  the IoT devices.  Companies should ensure making significant changes to their security  infrastructure to protect the influx of huge data and the growing number  of IoT devices. Network segmentation and advanced security systems  should be installed in IoT devices to prevent cyber-attacks.  ## The final verdict  Both IoT and big data are not just two sides of the same coin, but  they empower each other. There is no IoT without big data, and big data  can only make use of its potentiality when it is integrated into IoT.

I have heard rumors and am under the impression that qubic launches in december 2018. This is not fact, this is shaky conjecture and I can't source it. But, if it does hit january 1, 2019, that will give iota 1 year as the unrivaled fully scaled dapp platform.      There is a key thing that iota can do that could make it even more of a hit.

Investors may be forced into them, because of what is happening to PMs.  Yes, Bitcoin can be manipulated via the futures market, and it may be that over the next few months BTC gets smashed.

8249,0,"Hey guys,  Got  a bit of a question in regards to tax and trading. I've searched  everywhere but can't find an answer that relates to my specific  question, so I thought it'd be easier to just whack it here. My question  is in regards to trading once, or buying high and selling low.  EXAMPLE:  Lets say I got into crypto in January and invested 10k in IOTA that had a value of $2 per coin. So I now have 5,000 coins of  IOTA. Now I've held onto IOTA for the past 6 months in a declining  market and the coin is now worth $1 per coin (50&amp;#37; of my initial  investment). But I feel that the market will continue to decline so I  decide I want to sell my holdings of IOTA into FIAT and wait for it to  dip to $0.50 per coin before re-buying back in to ultimately double my  holdings.  In this example, I have sold at  a loss, and have just bought back in. From my understanding, you only  pay taxes on profit gains, which I have not done in the example.  Obviously should the coin go back up, I will gain much more now that I  have double my initial holdings. But my two questions are:  1. Do I have any tax to pay on that trade in my example, seeing as I bought high and sold low at a loss? 2. Once  I double my holdings, if the price of IOTA goes back up to $2 per  coin. Do I pay tax on the gains from my initial investment of 10k? Or do  I pay it from the value my investment was worth when I bought back in  (which would have been 5k after selling at a 50&amp;#37; loss initially)?  Hopefully  that all makes sense, but basically, if I sell at a lower price than I  initially bought in for, for the purposes of re-buying back in at a new  low to increase my holdings, what tax do I have to pay? If any?     I am in Australia, but am more looking for generalist tax understanding. I am aware that tax laws differ from country to country. ",Tax Question Regarding Trading

8253,0,"Whether you are a MIOTA/GIOTA holder or, like me, a broke student trying to survive, you might want to stack few more MIOTAs for free. Today I‚Äôd like to share with you my top 5 of the best ways I found to get free MIOTAs.  **5- IOTA FAUCET [UP TO 600 IOTAs/DAY]** The easiest way to get free IOTAs when the tip bot is alive. [IOTA FAUCET](https://np.reddit.com/r/IOTAFaucet/) 6 times a day, you can ask for 100 IOTAs.Yes, it‚Äôs not that much, but better than nothing! PROS: Easy CONS: Only few IOTAs/day  **4- MINING IOTA [UP TO FEW KIOTAs/DAY]** You can not really mine IOTA, but some websites are allowing you to mine a given crypto (e.g. Monero) and directly convert it into IOTAs. You don‚Äôt need to know anything. Just paste your address and decide what speed you want to spend on mining. This is how I earned my first KIOTAs.  It‚Äôs not really efficient tho, fees are high (they are at least taking 30% of your mining), but it‚Äôs a perfect way to get your first IOTAs to play with.  [IOTA MINING TOOL](https://mineiota.com/) PROS: Easy CONS: Few amount of IOTAs/day, may ruin your laptop  3- GAMBLING OR BETTING WITH IOTA [EXPECT FEW MIOTAs/DAY IF YOU DON‚ÄôT LOSE] I tried once and won. Although, I‚Äôm not really fan of gambling but‚Ä¶ If you know what you are doing, you can easily win several MIOTAs a day. You can go either with pure gamble games (Tangle Dice) or, if you feel lucky, bet on Football/Soccer games (CupIOTA). [TANGLE DICE]( https://tangledice.com/home) [CupIOTA](https://cupiota.com/)  PROS: Easy, you can win a lot CONS: Risky  **2- Wander on Reddit [FEW MIOTAs/DAY-WEEK]** They are many good people offering games or challenges with MIOTAs/BTC rewards: [This one with 5 MIOTAs reward]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/8jq3hd/evil_seedoku1/) [This Seedoku for 10 MIOTAs]( http://iotahosting.org/seedoku1/) [The famous BTC Puzzle]( https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/8kk0pa/1_btc_is_hidden_in_this_puzzle_good_luck/) [And obviously the ‚ÄòCFB troll face challenge for 1 GIOTA!!](https://np.reddit.com/r/Iota/comments/8663w9/competition_cfb_will_award_1gi_to_the_guy_who) Just wander on Reddit and. If you do not find anything, go with Giveaway. For instance, [Banano Coin](https://np.reddit.com/r/bananocoin/) will release soon it‚Äôs runner game where you can get Free Banano coins. It‚Äôs actually worth nothing but who knows, back in 2010 BTC was worth nothing either. I didn‚Äôt win anything so far‚Ä¶ But I live in hope :D  PROS: Rewards are big! CONS: Rare, sometimes hard and hard to be the first to win   **1- COMPLETE OFFERS [PLEASE READ ENTIRELY AND CAREFULLY TO GET ALL THE TRICKS] [UP TO MANY MIOTAs/DAY WITHOUT ANY RISK]**  The trickiest one. But if you use it properly, thanks to this trick, you can earn several MIOTAs a day for free. Obviously, it‚Äôs time consuming so do it when you have nothing else to do.  Website such as [Xenogift](https://xenogifts.com/register.php?r=b4efbc5342476e17d567f68717bb69ef) allow you to complete offers or watch video to earn coins (XenoCoins). You can then exchange those coins for MIOTAs, other cryptos, STEAM CARDS and more.  1st Trick ‚Äì Use this link By clicking on any of these [Xenogift LINK](https://xenogifts.com/register.php?r=b4efbc5342476e17d567f68717bb69ef), I will be one of your referral and both of us will get a bonus of 200 XenoCoins (200.000 IOTAs). If you do not want, just google Xenogift and register normally. 1st Trick Bis ‚Äì Do several times the same offer! I advise you to use mostly the first publisher (Ad Gate MEDIA) because of the amount and variety of offers. Although you have many different Offer wall publisher (Offer Torro, Wanna ads) available on the website. And there is redundancy between the offers, which means that you can complete several times the same offer with different publishers. This will be useful for the next trick. 2nd Trick ‚Äì Use AdBlock, a good antivirus and Eannan earner The best way to earn Coins on this website is to go with the Shitty Quiz. If you score a perfect score, you get the reward. What is tricky over here is i) first the fact that internet pages on which quiz is are full of ads (they are making money with every click).The first time, I didn‚Äôt even know where to click. If not already done, install adBlock extension, it will help you by blocking most of the ads.  ii) Second, these quizzes are really shitty and tricky. Almost impossible to answer perfectly. Except if you are using websites like [Eannan Earner]( https://eannanearner.blogspot.com/2018/05/easter-find-word.html).  This website gives you all the answers for these quizzes. No need to search by yourself. Thanks to that, it takes me only few seconds to answer a quiz and get the reward (often superior to 100.000 IOTAs).  If you can not find the answers to the quiz with Eannan earner, use either reddit [Example of people sharing the answers]( https://np.reddit.com/r/SwagBucks/comments/7uy5nm/answers_to_easy_english_spelling_bee_in_discover/) or [Freetrick]( https://freetricks2earn.blogspot.com/2018/01/easy-english-spelling-bee-quiz-with.html) Although, with Freetrick, you will have to go through a pile of Ads before getting the answers. But this website is always up to date because publishers may change the quizzes, order of questions or even answers.   Finally, be sure to have a good antivirus. Personally, I do not trust these websites full of ads. AND MOST IMPORTANT THING: Redo the same quiz with different publisher. Like I said before, you can complete several times the same offer with different publishers. 3rd Trick ‚Äì Go with the free trials. I was a bit sceptical with that, but obviously, because you give your credit card infos, these offers are the most attractive one (up to 5 MIOTA/offer). For this one, I first tried offers implying really well-known websites (e.g. CBS illimited for 5 days / 2MIOTAS reward). It worked really well. I subscribed to the offer, waited 5 minutes, get my 2000 Xenocoins and then unsubscribed from CBS. 1 or 2$ were taken from the credit card and given back few hours after. So, I didn‚Äôt pay a single penny, got free access to CBS for 5 days and got 2 MIOTAs for free. Obviously, they are making money with people forgetting to cancel their account. So, do not forget to cancel. IT‚ÄôS REALLY IMPORTANT TO GO WITH WELL KNOWN WEBSITE! Obviously, I wanted more and started to look at other offers. Example: subscribe to MovieFlix for 6000 xenocoins (More than 6 MIOTAs). Sexy‚Ä¶ First: quick research on google: It was hard to find this website. Second, research on google with the name of the website + scam. Not really reassuring. Third, by clicking on the offer, I ended up on a shitty website to rent books‚Ä¶ Quickly check the reputation of the website before giving your credit card info‚Äôs. So far, I tried 3 with this method and all of them worked nicely. Last thing. Never forget to cancel your subscription and be aware that some websites like that will only allow you to cancel your subscription after few days (5 days free subscription that you can only cancel after 4 days. You only have 1-day window to cancel otherwise, your real subscription will start).   4th Trick ‚Äì Watch ads Sounds stupid like that but you can easily make 100.000 IOTAs/hour like that. You can create and link or not your ad account (Smores for instance) to your Xenogift account. I advice you to chose a channel were ads are shorter than 1min20sec (I usually go with Phone app channel which offers 50 sec ads). Leave your laptop and do something else. Check every 1 or 2 hours that ads are still running and when you need your laptop, stop it. For comparison, when I mined IOTA, I made 0.23 IOTA/s with IOTA mining website. It will take me 50 days to reach 1 MIOTA (while probably destroying my laptop). Just by leaving ads on my laptop, I can easily have 1 MIOTA every 2 days. I wouldn‚Äôt leave if overnight tho given that after 2-3hours, it happened often that ads are lagging. I end up stuck on the same ad and I have to refresh the page.   5th trick Download free apps There are many offers which implies to download and open free apps. It works really well but the rewards are not really big. If you are patient, do like me: I made most of my MIOTAs with hard offers such as the one for Final Fantasy X: download app for the first time and reach city level 10. It took me 4 days by playing 30 min a day but at the end, I got 6000 Xenocoins (more than 6 MIOTAs). Do not hesitate to go with offers like that if you have the time. Rewards are nice and once again free.    6th DO NOT EVEN TRY THE GRAND SAVING CENTER FREE SUBSCRIPTION OFFERS! These offers look really nice (sign up confirm e-mail and get 800 Xenocoin (almost 1 MIOTA!)) but are pure crap! Even if they Imply many famous brands (McDO, Subway, Starbucks etc.), I never succeed to complete any. You start your subscription, give your name, birth date, e-mail and have one last step to complete the offer which is: complete another offer. And so on. It‚Äôs endless and can not be completed. So, stay away from these and in general, offers which sounds too good to be true. 7th Exchange your coins when MIOTA price is low Ratio XenoCoin/MIOTA is automatically adjusted according to MIOTA price. If MIOTA is going down, it‚Äôs cheaper (like with FIAT). So wait before spending your XenoCoin.   If you want to try: [XENOGIFT]( https://xenogifts.com/register.php?r=b4efbc5342476e17d567f68717bb69ef)  PROS: Easy to earn many MIOTAs, FREE!, Better than mining tool to ‚Äòmine‚Äô IOTAs CONS: Must wait 5 days before receiving your MIOTAs, Must work actively to get the rewards  **CONCLUSION** So far, these are the best ways I found to get free MIOTAs. If you have any advice or comments, feel free. Like I said before: If you are a GIOTA holder, I don‚Äôt think you will bother yourself with that. Especially if you can buy more MIOTAs and enjoy the dip! But if you are like me, in a position that you can not buy anything but convinced that every MIOTA will make the difference, feel free to try and enjoy!",[TUTORIAL] TOP 5 OF THE BEST WAYS TO GET FREE MIOTAs

Im pretty sure IOTA will be the number one in some years, but is it possible that the actual marketcap @crypto does not show the reality and IOTA will be 1st in cryptospace but with a MIOTA token worth of just 50cent? Hope u get what I mean, cause thats my only struggle in not investing more money in IOTA (I feel the whole market crashing soon, dont want to spread FUD, just my personal feeling).

8295,0,"I think we are about ready to start the slow climb back up.  Could bitcoin go down a bit more? Yes.  Is it close of enough to the bottom to start buying back in?  Damn straight.  Why do I think this?  1. Mt. Gox selling is over. I think this is pretty much the largest contributor for tanking markets recently. All the other explanations ‚Äì hack this, regulation that ‚Äì are people looking for reasons where there was only ignorance. 2. Institutional investors have been patiently waiting. They have been sitting on the sidelines watching the average people get decimated. I think they felt stupid for ignoring cryptos while the ‚Äúdumb money‚Äù was making a fortune, and now that almost all of the latecomers have gotten their asses kicked lately, they‚Äôre ready to step in and be the ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù yet again.  Once they start dipping their toes in, it will be a free-for-all. Few firms will watch their competitors reap insane returns without trying investments themselves. Granted, investments may be small relative to their normal holdings, but even a small fraction of institutional money entering the market will fundamentally change the crypto space. 3. General psychology. Once you‚Äôve experienced ridiculous gains like people have investing in crypto, it‚Äôs extremely difficult to go back to ‚Äúsafe‚Äù investments (that is, if you consider anything safe these days). It‚Äôs kind of like snorting cocaine ever morning with breakfast for a year and half and then trying to get your day going with chamomile tea instead. Probably not so easy to adjust.  Besides, I think because most late comers have been decimated, the ones that are still around have reached the ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù stage of investing (myself included).  All this should help IOTA significantly.  As more people enter (especially smart money) they will look beyond BTC, ETH and XRP, and start studying others to search for bargains.

8310,0,"[Our speculation in the previous market commentary](https://old.reddit.com/r/IOTAmarkets/comments/8rlyib/market_commentary_15th_16th_june_2018/), namely that Bitcoin would shortly retest resistance at $6,750, was proven correct by price action on Monday. BTC jumped from around $6,500 to a weekly high of $6,850 before falling back to trade around $6,750 on Tuesday and Wednesday after price again failed (twice) to take $6,850.   [The weekly chart](https://imgur.com/Nyt6Bh1) shows a Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 43.8, up from 42.5 over the weekend. A small positive increase in the weekly RSI has occurred in each of the previous positive corrections, which suggests that the Bitcoin will begin its third correction to the upside sometime within the next 2 weeks. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a 365 points spread  (down from 380 over the weekend) between the 12 week moving average (WMA) at -483 (-423) and the 26 WMA at -119 (-42). Although momentum continues to be negative, we are seeing a slight deceleration in negative momentum in the weekly timeframe, which also suggests prices may go higher in the next few weeks before retesting lows in the coming months.   [In the daily chart](https://imgur.com/F3mz5uF), the RSI is 41.5 (35). Although RSI has increased noticeably in the last few days, price has not, suggesting that the Bitcoin is making room in its indicators to trade towards the low in its present range before heading higher next week. The MACD shows a spread of 20 between (-64) between the 12 day moving average (DMA) at -344 (-415) and the 26 DMA -364 (-346). We are therefore seeing a possible bullish crossover in the MACD, despite momentum remaining negative on a daily basis. Momentum in the MACD since the beginning of June is similar to what we saw between March 22nd and April 7th. The second positive correction fired on April 12th, five days after there was a bullish crossover in the MACD for the second time. We can therefore make a guess that the third positive correction will occur towards the beginning of the week commencing Monday, June 25th. As previously noted, our target for this correction is $7,650, or about 13&amp;#37; higher than current prices.   [Turning lastly to the hourly chart](https://imgur.com/NoWRLHQ), the RSI is 62 (54), and the MACD shows a 5 point spread (12) between the 12 DMA at 23 (1) and 26 DMA at -15 (-11). At present, I expect Bitcoin to trade in steps to $7,100, before falling back and beginning its correction next week.   MIOTA is trading off its weekly low of $1.09, but could not sustain a bullish move above $1.23. The tangle-based crypto is trading steadily around $1.16 with neutral indicators.   I have no positions in BTC or MIOTA and have no intention to initiate a position within the next 72 hours.","Market Commentary 17th-20th June, 2018"

But the alternative - what we are all hoping for - will be for IOTA to succeed and become a major player in how 100 Billion IOT devices will exchange value. We were all fascinated my Bitcoins rise in value, which was driven by just a few speculative investors and made early adopters filthy rich. What we have to keep in mind here, is that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies only have a potential user base of up to 7 billion humans. IOTA however will be used my humans AND machines, making its potential user base bigger by a tremendous factor. Any car, weather sensor, cloud computer and use cases we can't even think about yet will need some network to exchange data and value. So IF IOTA actually succeeds, it will increase its value by factors that were never seen in the cryptosphere before and we all will become insanely wealthy people. The bitcoin bubble will just be a tiny part of crypto history, soon to be forgotten and replaced by the rise of IOTA.

8349,0,"On Friday, Bitcoin traded 3&amp;#37; lower on slightly below average volume from $6,600 to $6,400. Volume and price continued to fall on Saturday as the cryptocurrency slid another percent and a half to $6,300, where it found support and briefly rallied above $6,500 before again showing weakness late in the day.   In[ the weekly chart](https://imgur.com/M2Chlzi), the Relative Strength Index (RSI) has fallen half a point to 42.5, a level last seen in August 2015 when BTC was trading beneath $250. The RSI has another 12.5 points to fall in the weekly timeframe before the indicator would suggest BTC is oversold. There is therefore some evidence that the Bitcoin will make new lows beneath $5,900 in the coming weeks and months. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a 380 point spread (up from 377 on Wednesday) between the 12 day moving average (DMA) at -423 (-400 on Wednesday) and the 26 DMA at -42 (-24). Momentum is therefore becoming more negative, and is also showing a slight acceleration in the last two trading days. Considering that the 26 DMA has only just recently turned negative this week, there is still considerable room in the MACD, as in the RSI, to sustain downward pressure to new lows in the next few months.   Turning to [the daily chart](https://imgur.com/mpmQM7C), the RSI is unchanged from Wednesday at 35, although it reached a low of 31.5 in trading on Friday before price moved back above $6,500. The MACD shows a spread of 69 (64) between the 12 DMA at -415 (-390) and 26 DMA -346 (-326), showing a marginal increase in momentum to the downside in this timeframe. The Bitcoin is showing some reluctance to be oversold on a daily basis, however, according to the RSI. If we [expand the timeframe on the daily chart](https://imgur.com/VzUGWuo), we can see that throughout the entire market crash, the RSI on the daily chart has only fallen below 30 twice, including in this past week.  The first time the RSI fell beneath 30 on February 5th, the Bitcoin started a positive correction that saw its price double from $5,900 to almost $12,000. The RSI also reached a low of 30 on March 30th and April 1st when BTC was trading at $6,500. Again, price tried to break immediately to the upside, and after $7,500 was taken on the April 4th, resistance pushed Bitcoin lower to retest $6,500 on April 5th &amp; 6th. The Bitcoin then began it's second positive correction in the market crash on April 12th, eventually finding resistance at $10,000 and falling back to current levels.   In short, the Bitcoin immediately bounced back after the RSI first reached 30, and bounced back shortly after it reached oversold territory the second time round. This is consistent with the second wave of the market crash being less volatile than the first. Assuming that the third wave will be less volatile than the second, and observing that the Bitcoin traded in a $1,000 range between $6,450 to $7,500 for a period of 12 days before the second positive correction between March 30th and April 12th, we can make an educated guess that the Bitcoin will trade in a similar range of between $6,100 and $7,100 until the end of June or early July before price goes higher. It is also possible, however, that the Bitcoin tests the $5,900 low established by the first crash wave in the next couple of weeks. With the daily RSI showing the Bitcoin to be oversold, and the longer-term DMA on the MACD just falling below 0, it seems more likely that the Bitcoin make a lower high before it makes a lower low.   We therefore have a potential trading opportunity, although with less potential upside due to lower volatility the risk-reward profile is weaker for a trading a third positive correction than was the case for the first and second corrections. We can get an idea of the potential upside in a third correction by observing that the first correction, second crash wave, and second correction all took about a month to play out. The third crash wave has taken about a month and a half to trade to the lows though, so we can expect a similar timeframe for the third correction. [Extending the downward trend from the highs from the previous corrections, and looking at where price may be around the beginning of August](https://imgur.com/saWArCQ), we arrive at an estimate of around $7,650. This price target implies an upside of 17.7&amp;#37; from current levels, and 18.9&amp;#37; from the anticipated short term range low of $6,100. Considering the long trade duration, limited upside, risk of Bitcoin making new lows this wave, and other opportunities in equity options that have a much, much better risk-reward profile, I do not recommend attempting to initiate a trade to capture the value of a third correction.   In [the hourly chart](https://imgur.com/BEV2vMv), the RSI is 54 (61), and the MACD shows a 12 point spread (16) between the 12 DMA at 1 (52) and 26 DMA at -11 (26). Neither the RSI or MACD have fallen significantly, and indeed look poised to move higher to retest resistance at $6,750. I therefore now expect Bitcoin to trade towards $7,100 in the coming days before trying to make new lows next week.   Price action in MIOTA reflected BTC, but was more negative. Most alts continue to demonstrate comparatively greater weakness than Bitcoin when BTC is at its lows.   I have no positions in BTC or MIOTA and have no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.","Market Commentary 15th &amp; 16th June, 2018"

8364,0,"The Bitcoin traded from $6,300 to an intraday high of $6,737 (+6.9&amp;#37;) on average volume before pulling back slightly to trade around $6,600 (+4.8&amp;#37;) late in the day.   Observing [the weekly chart](https://i.imgur.com/JawKE0T.png), Bitcoin remains in a crash pattern. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 43, indicating that BTC is not oversold in the weekly timeframe. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a 377 point spread between the 12 day moving average (DMA) at -400 and the 26 DMA at -24. Momentum therefore continues to be steadily to the downside in general.   In [the daily chart](https://i.imgur.com/KCjwogp.png), the RSI is 35, meaning that BTC is no longer oversold on a daily basis. The MACD shows a 64 points spread between the 12 DMA at -390 and the 26 DMA at -326. The negative momentum in the daily timeframe has been relatively steady since late May, suggesting that we will continue to see a more moderate level of volatility in the medium term, with the exception of event-driven market action, such as hacks.    Looking at [the hourly chart](https://i.imgur.com/4zyfGmU.png), the RSI is 61, and the MACD shows a 16 point spread between 12 DMA at 52 and 26 DMA 36. The MACD is small positive but turning, suggesting that positive hourly momentum may soon reverse. As we can see in the last few weeks, the MACD has struggled to stay small positive at levels similar to its current price. We can also see that the price support that was built earlier in the week at $6,600 is now acting as resistance. If upward momentum continues, bulls will be tested at $6,900 and $7,300 before facing major resistance at $7,700. RSI and MACD suggest that momentum can drive price to $6,900, but probably not very much further. Lows of $5,900-$6,200 will likely be retested in the short term (1-7 days). The bullish scenario sees Bitcoin trade neutrally in a range between $6,200 and $7,700 in the medium term (1-4 weeks). The risk-reward profile for trading BTC on a daily or hourly basis is not attractive while the price remains in the middle of its assumed short term range of $5,900-$6,900.   Price action in MIOTA reflected BTC but was more muted.   I have no positions in BTC or MIOTA and have no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours. ","Market Commentary 14th June, 2018"

8379,0,"Bitcoin reached a low of $6,107 on Wednesday before meeting resistance and consolidating to trade around $6,300.   Observing the weekly chart, it is clear that the Bitcoin remains in a crash pattern. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is 42, indicating that BTC is not oversold in the weekly timeframe. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) shows a widening spread between the 12 and 26 week moving averages, suggesting that negative momentum is again accelerating after market corrections to the upside throughout February and April.   Turning to the daily chart, the RSI is 34, indicating that the Bitcoin is a little oversold in the daily timeframe.  The short\-term moving average on the MACD has crossed the longer\-term moving average to the downside, which suggests that negative momentum is again accelerating after the brief reprise in late May/early June that saw BTC test resistance at $7,800.   In the hourly chart, the RSI is 44 and the MACD shows a potential swing in momentum towards the upside. However, the MACD has given two false indications to the upside in the last 24 hours, and volume behind the move towards $6,450 is limited. The TTM Squeeze indicator shows that the Bitcoin's Bollinger Bands are outside of the Keltner Channels, suggesting that there is no imminent volatility to sustain a significant move upwards.     On the balance of probabilities, risk remains strongly weighted to the downside in the short (1\-7 days), medium (1\-4 weeks), and long term (1\-12 months). Expect the previous lows of $6,000 and $5,900 to be retested in the short to medium term. Buy and hold positions should not be initiated at this time as the long\-term will very likely offer prices below $6,000. Intraday volatility is less than in Q1 but still remains high, indicating we are in the third and final wave of the market crash. The third wave is the least volatile and slowest, and longer term investors should wait for low intraday volatility (a sign that sellers have been exhausted) before buying. Active and experienced traders may look to initiate unleveraged long positions around $5,500\-$6,000 on the back of momentum to the upside in volume. However, due to lower volatility, longs will have to hold on for longer to make less return.   The price action in Iota continues to shadow the Bitcoin, and will likely continue to do so until the market is no longer in a crash pattern. ","Market Commentary June 13th, 2018"

Mainly to avoid spam attacks. The EM spectrum is a resource of that kind (see [Bandwith Allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_allocation)) so if you can prove that you used X range of it for Y time, you can use it as PoW with little devices that have non computational built\-in capabilities. This kind of PoW would be used only by IoT devices, with this characteristics.  There is also the ""Sender Test"" (see [Radio Resource Tests](https://www.slideshare.net/diogomonica/on-the-use-of-radio-resource-tests-in-wireless-ad-hoc-networks)) that ""assumes that nodes cannot simultaneously transmit in more than one channel"". This could potentially be another way to validate trusted nodes via the EM spectrum.  All this goes together with [EC](https://medium.com/@comefrombeyond/economic-clustering-and-iota-d3a77388900)[ and is not designed thinking in what CFB called ""Cluster0""](https://medium.com/@comefrombeyond/economic-clustering-and-iota-d3a77388900) (which is where we are now, btw).

Where is the complex systems that are harvesting food, mining, etc. Where are the forests of solar panels?   To make iota great, we need a machine economy. We need an economy where people own machines, and that machine ownership generates money on behalf of the human owner. But to get that, we need to take a step back, and look at what that economy needs. The machine economy needs labourers, and to get machine labour, we need a way for machines to not be dumb labour. We need a data market, but we also need a mechanized labour market.

8405,0,"Something that has been on my mind for a while is the general awareness and sentiment about IOTA in the greater crypto community. In the generally crypto subs like r/cryptocurrency or r/cryptomarkets I feel like there is a general unawareness of IOTA, even in relation to its market cap. Generally speaking, I would expect the amount of discussion on a coin to approximately follow its market cap, so obviously everyone would know and talk about BTC, ETH, XRP and so on. Yet lots of coins with smaller market caps seem to be discussed or brought up a lot more frequently in the crypto communities. I seem to see coins like Neo, Tron, Monero, Nano etc being discussed a lot more than iota, and when reading general articles about cryptos or Bitcoin alternatives things seem to be the same. If I just spent my time reading about cryptos and didn‚Äôt look at market caps, I would NOT expect IOTA to be  at #9. What surprises me too is that because of the focus on IoT, people seem to forget that a crypto engineered for IoT can still be used as peer-to-peer cash, and if anything IOTA hits the original use case of crypto as digital cash the best with the zero fee network. Again, this is something that doesn‚Äôt seem to be brought up in other discussions. There‚Äôs a good chance this is just because I have a very positive view of iota and it‚Äôs a sort of ‚Äúconfirmation bias‚Äù, but I really feel like IOTA is flying under the radar. There are so many great things about it that no one seems to care about. It doesn‚Äôt really matter, it‚Äôs just something I have been noticing. The awareness in the more general community just seems a bit absent. Anyone feel similarly?   tl;dr: General awareness of iota feels low.

8435,0,"For some reason my post on announcing the Bitpanda listing was automatically removed but I thought I‚Äôd post it as this and let you know the main features of Bitpanda and why it‚Äôs a really solid exchange for IOTA to be listed on :)  Just got this email from Bitpanda announcing they‚Äôll be adding IOTA on the 14th June which is amazing for any UK and EU people. Just a quick summary of the exchange:  -Only currently lists around 4-5 coins so it‚Äôll get a lot of attention  -They offer deposits in EUR, GBP and more direct via free bank transfers, VISA debit and more  -only charge a 1.25-1.5% fee which compared to other exchanges is a very good deal  -it techinally will be a Fiat/IOTA pairing since you can deposit directly into the exchange wallet in your currency and then buy IOTA directly with that fiat wallet as opposed to needing to buy ETH first for example  Overall Bitpanda is my main exchange and I‚Äôve never had any issues with it. Furthermore they did a massive website overhaul only recently and its become a lot more visually appealing and easy to use so if you‚Äôre needing a new exchange then I‚Äôd definitely recommend it also!

8467,0,"I have not seen a post on this yet, which is surprising since this is \*one\* of the biggest implications of the whole release IMO.  ## PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER  As imagined in the Qubic [teaser video](https://qubic.iota.org/static/teaser_720p.mp4), here is a set of qubics \(specifically: an oracle machine, an outsourced computation, and a smart contract\) which work together and evolve over time to do something useful \- in this case, foreign exchange trading.  1. **Exchange rate qubic**: serves as a primitive oracle machine that periodically publishes the exchange rate on the Tangle. The data originator may be predefined or not. In this scenario the oracles fetch data from beyond the Tangle environment which is impossible to get via other means. 2. **Forex prediction qubic**: takes the data supplied by the exchange rate qubic and predicts the rate for the immediate future. In this scenario the oracles perform intensive outsourced computations, which would be too difficult or expensive to do on low\-level devices. 3. **Portfolio management qubic**: takes the data supplied by both of the above qubics and sells or buys pegged virtual USD for pegged virtual EUR. In this scenario the oracles execute a smart contract which allows the owner not to have to handle all trading manually.  I don't know if you all realize just how large the FOREX markets are.  ## Trading volume  The forex market, according to the 2016 Triennial Central Bank Survey of FX and over\-the\-counter \(OTC\) derivatives markets, has a jaw\-dropping daily turnover of **$5.1 trillion**. The US dollar continues to remain the dominant vehicle currency.  The New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE for short, is the largest equities exchange based on total market capitalisation of its listed securities, and has a daily turnover of around **$40 billion**.  According to SIMFA \(Securities Industry and Financial Markets Associations\), the average daily trading volume for US government treasury bonds is around **$530 billion**. While the US has the largest bond market in the world, followed by Japan, it does not even scratch the surface when placed next to forex.  Although the above is very impressive, what does it mean to us as individual speculators? Well, trading a highly liquid market, such as forex, enables participants to receive quick trade execution. Furthermore, it limits the amount of trading gaps which can make a market considerably difficult to trade!  Forex markets have a \*DAILY\* turnover 1000X larger than IOTA's current market cap. With Qubic, people will be able to automate trades on the forex markets by utilizing outsourced computational power and machine learning to dictate real\-time trades. Couple this with the expansion in machine learning we will be able to realize with such a large network, and IOTA has a shot of becoming the de\-facto intermediary currency on the forex markets.  whether or not IOTA becomes the standard, and small market share in this market is worth about as much as the entire NYSE. The way I see it, trades with IOTA on forex may not be long investments, however it will raise our volume, and float value immensely, and this is only ONE of the opportunities Qubic enables.

Like, the world was watching via big media. Also of note, I remember the vast distance between addresses was emphasized, but it was technically a ubiquitous and ""behind the scenes"" transaction; he was just letting everyone watch in on the process.  From the moment the transaction was sent from one end, it was ""instantly"" completed and verified on the other. A delay existed and was recorded as 20\-something picoseconds. Inconsequential really, but I remember thinking the transaction was confirmed not only in a jiffy, but faster than a jiffy \(if you didn't already know, a jiffy is a unit of time proposed to be equal to how long it takes for light to travel 1 centimeter in a vacuum or approximately 33.3564 picoseconds\).  **TL;DR** I didn't wake up in a new bugatti, but Dominik did a public demonstration that convinced me I could buy one in the future if I wanted.

8506,0,"I‚Äôm sorry if this has been asked before but can someone help me understand this please. I‚Äôve been confused about the never using the same seed you sent from. I‚Äôve only ever sent MIOTA to my seed, never from it. What happens once I send from it?

",Wallet and seed Question
8507,0,"I think the recent news of Richard Soley joining the supervisory board is kind of underrated.  With his connections to Object Management Group IIC, Eclipse Foundation and many more standardization clubs, he can place IOTA in the best possible position you can wish for, to become an IoT standard.  And if that happens, IOTA is ready for it's ultimate goal: ""enabling the true Internet-of-Things through the Machine Economy"". Simply because IoT manufacturers will pick standards as a first choice for communication between their products. And guess who's already heavily connected with IOTA: Bosch and Fujitsu, one of the biggest IoT hardware manufacturers in the world.  Also, IOTA can do much more than just function as a distributed m2m communication protocol: it can function as a tamper-proof monitoring system of supply chains, or you can use it for secure identity management. This means that it will possibily lead to multiple open-source industrial standards based on IOTA.  Given the fact that the IoT market will grow exponentially coming years... I can only say: verrrry very exciting years ahead for IOTA.",IOTA as a standard for the M2M economy

8527,0,"Remember back in 2009\-2011? Getting that first cmd wallet. Bitcoin forums. 10,000 bitcoins for 2 pizzas. First transactions. Mining bitcoins on a cpu meant to play starcraft 1. Magic the gathering online exchange. Back then, high hopes were 1 btc would someday be worth $100. Someday it would moon, and the dude with 5,000 bitcoins would be able to pay off his suburban home for hodling. Buying a btc mining pc with student loan money. Lying to the folks over $20 that was meant for groceries but spent on btc. Selling said btc due to needing to pay rent.   People in iota right now think that the moon is $10 or $25 or even $40. haha. I have seen this roadshow before, and I know where it ends in 10 years. Iota has the scaling power bitcoin and ethereum never had before, and never will have. Ethereum can shard and casper and metropolis their way hither and thither, but they are just splitting up their kingdom into tiny fiefdoms, and trying to use rule of law to run the kingdom. Iota is a single monolithic, single minded entity. It has never been forked, \(and probably never will be, due to no miners\) It has greater throughput aka scaling and it has better data storage due to supporting trinary.   Picture a city of the future. The air is thick with drones. The skyscrapers press up against each other casting the streets into gloom. The walkways and catwalks are overcrowded because it is faster to walk or take public transportation than to drive to work. Shops on every corner selling devices and items you are unfamiliar with, for currency you heard of in the ancient days of 2018. Take in the smell. That's the smell of a 2,779,530,283,277,761 iota economy. What's an iota? Well, 200 iota will buy you a burger. 1 miota will buy you a decent hoverboard, or an old style gas car.  1giota is a fortune.  In 10 years, the US dollar will have inflated at 2&amp;#37; per year. That is slightly over 20&amp;#37; devaluation from today, counting compounding inflation. The current US boom will have collapsed in a spectacular bust. Industries will have toppled, and power will have become ever more concentrated in the hands of a few. Elon may have done his first mars trip. It might even have been manned. Coastal flooding will have forced the retreat of thousands of people. Homes will be built sturdier or not at all in hurricane country as the storms get fiercer. Worst case scenarios for global warming will be in full swing. Human overpopulation will be worse than ever. Lifespan will be tied more and more to wealth as the aging rich get to afford life extending treatments. Flying taxi cars will be a thing, as will quadcopter style hoverboards. Amazon delivery drones will be everywhere. Charging stations for drones will be everywhere, and AI will have made serious leaps and bounds. The cutting edge google AI bots that do natural language processing will be able to hold complex rational arguments. Many jobs will have been automated and even jobs that people think are immune to automation will be gone. Businesses will cater to machine, cyborg and human customers, and AI will be giving humans a very stiff run for their money. Even jobs requiring a human touch will be in deep competition with the synthetics.   The technology to keep a human brain alive in a jar after death will be a thing. It won't be used often, but we will be able to do it. Automated swarm technology will be a thing. Cybernetic implants will be a thing. Personal AI will be a thing. Ever taller skyscrapers and ever broader megapolis will be a thing. Mind reading hardware with AI to interpret thoughts will be a thing. And where will iota be?   Well, for starters, none of the machines will pay in dollars. Traders will use iota with smart contracts and leverage them to control other assets. The tangle will be multiple terabytes in size, if not petabytes. Tangle smart contracts will replace legal agreements. Maidsafe will have integrated with the tangle, and tangle permanodes will run on maidsafe virtual nodes, if the tangle doesn't straight up push its own virtual nodes.   If you have ever seen the movie ghost in the shell, that is what the future will look like. And iota is the currency that world will run on. So, remember the days when bitcoin was $1, and bitcoin moon was $10. Remember the days when Iota was $1.50 and iota moon was $15. Because in ten years, 1 iota may very well be worth 1 penny.  Stock up, because the coming world isn't a cakewalk, and it's not a world any of us would think of as idyllic, but we will be damned if we don't walk into that world as rich as kings.",Remember the days...
8528,0,"Hi guys haven't fully understood the technical side of IOTA yet so bare with me. But smart contract solutions are basically where all value in supply chains is at the moment. Do we think that IOTA can position themselves for a smart contract platform that will be more reliable than something like IBM's hyperledger, ziliqa or PoS eth?   Please don't see this as me having no faith. I'm just concerned as to if this IOT land is enterprise ready",Is blockchain competitive to DAG?
8529,0,"Hi guys,  Stupid question but I like to foster discussion: requently I see most advancements within iota foundation compared to many other blockchain/tangle project. The announcement about oracles, smart contracts etc, the unending number of professionals added to the team, the interest and even commitment of huge companies etc etc not to mentioned the use case of machine learning, algorithms, AI all based on data (90% data generated worldwide is from last 2 years). So for me this is huge and I'm learning a lot about fintech, innovations and so on as well as about iota.  But how does this correlate to price of iota? I'm not about to get rich quick guy, I'm invested before ATH last December, so way earlier when it was about technology and iota wasn't even mentioned anywhere. But I'm curious about the scenario that if iota archives what they are planning on doing, basically being the backbone of the data age and connecting machines 2 machines payments, free and scalable, taking away data silos and AI learning with new added data etc etc and it should be applied on a global scale.... Will this affect the price of miota at all?  Is it just demand and supply and supply is limited and demand is growing as miota is needed to pay for goods, this would affect it, correct?  What are your thoughts about correlation here? ",ELI5 cause and effect price on R&amp;D

The market would triple it's currently value and so would IOTA.  1 MIOTA would be $5 just by natural market growth.  We all know though IOTA has massive prospects, partnerships and technology that will ensure growth beyond the general market trend.  IF IOTA obtained 4th Spot behind BTC, ETH &amp; XRP we would see a $20 MIOTA if the market reached $1Trillion.

8587,0,"&amp;nbsp;  Before Gutenberg invented the printing machine, reading and writing was an exclusive skill held by the elite. This huge gap in knowledge and wisdom gave the elite the power to suppress its people.    Today we are more enlightened than ever as information flows freely onto our computer screens, turning us into well informed individuals. Most of us fail to admit to that we cannot read or write the most important and powerful language of this century: Programming language.  We used this newfound language to optimize and digitize the world we know and understand, got more efficient at doing what we kinda always did and fitted the code into our existing system as we built new infrastructure to broaden its impact. Bitcoin is a bit different however, as the code *is* the system. There are many participants in it, as they participate without permission and without fear of being censored. However, only one group can change the bounds within one can participate.  &amp;nbsp;  This catapulted developers (i‚Äôll use this term for simplicity) into figureheads with authority and supposed wisdom about society -- and how to fix it. A demanding role to say the least.   Shoemakers, way beyond the shoe.  Proof of this new phenomena was first observed when the bitcoin community split into two opposing tribes, mostly because of one single parameter found deep inside the holy scriptures of strings and symbols. Blocksize. To cap, or not to cap, that is the question.  To this day, the rich enlightened literate elite of each tribe throws arguments at each other in public debates, while the angry illiterate mob cheers on their respective side and curses its enemies into oblivion.  &amp;nbsp;  SCAMMER! FRAUD! BABIES ARE DYING!  WE ARE THE REAL BITCOIN! LAYER TWO IS THE SOLUTION! -- WHAT WOULD SATOSHI SAY!?  &amp;nbsp;  I have a feeling what Satoshi would say. And i don't think either side would want to hear it.  The case bitcoin maximalists make is really appealing to me personally. There are many lessons to be learned from it. But as development is funded by Venture Capital flowing into for-profits with unclear structures and motives with no apparent desire for transparency - the great Blockchain disruption turned into a new establishment which no longer can uphold its own values imposed by early adopters. A look behind closed doors into what was supposed to disrupt ‚Äûbehind closed door‚Äú monetary policy:  https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7c29kk/blockstream_investor_emails_leaked_shows/  &amp;nbsp;  The smokescreen of a libertarian pipedream gave astute business men the perfect opportunity to turn a quick buck. I find a for-profit working on Bitcoin and Lightning Network, who sends out private emails to investors about their agenda questionable.   &amp;nbsp;  The fact that there is no yearly ‚ÄúBitcoin Transparency Report‚Äù, in which not only developers disclose financial interest, but also Mining Pools, ASIC Producers etc. come together with open cards and *at least try* to have an open dialogue with each other, makes me confident enough to make the argument that Bitcoin failed most of its early promises and probably always will. We had the chance to do better. We didn‚Äôt.  The result of this is zero adoption by the broader public or enterprises. Because by doing so you would empower this newly formed establishment. There is no incentive for most to do so, unless you are part of it.  What once was meant to disrupt the ‚Äúbehind closed doors‚Äù establishment turned into exactly that. **A behind closed doors establishment that manifests itself in a language most people do not understand.** It must be convenient to have an opposing tribe you can shift the focus to.     *‚ÄúWar is a necessary tool for the Party because it keeps the standard of living in check, maintaining the inequalities essential to a totalitarian state.‚Äù* - George Orwell on the State of Bitcoin. Wait what.   &amp;nbsp;  Once we can admit that the liberal bitcoin dream has failed we can make the following point: Transparent governance is important. Fuck your ideology.  &amp;nbsp;    **Technology can change the world for the better, but only if people of good will work together to make sure it‚Äôs designed and deployed in ways that protect and benefit everyone.**   &amp;nbsp;  I quoted this last bit from the IOTA website.

8595,0,"I really hate the ""coordinator is not decentralized"" argument, but it is a somewhat valid argument. These people who make this argument look at what iota is today, not what it is tomorrow. They also make an argument loaded with ALOT of meaning. Centralization vs decentralization.   1. Nobody in the world can zero out the iota balances on other people devices. 2. If the coordinator were pulled today, the network would run. It would also potentially be hackable like verge.  3. If the coordinator deliberately chooses not to confirm a transaction, there is probably a reason for it like it being a bad transaction. Second, if another transaction approves that bad transaction, then their transaction is going to be lost to the void.   So, when people claim iota is not decentralized, they are lying. What they should be claiming is that iota's security against a 51&amp;#37; attack has a lynchpin that is not decentralized. ",Coordinator is not decentralized - oh really?

8602,0,"Newbies to iota get a confusing mix up between the gossip protocol of iota, and the tangle protocol of iota.   With blockchain, the gossip protocol is established by the phrase ""each block is broadcast to the network"" With tangle, the gossip protocol is confused with the phrase that ""each transaction is broadcast to the network"" without the qualifying phrase that each transaction is also written to the internal tangle of each node. Without this qualifying statement a newbie can get lost in a forest of bizzare questions.   My personal question of ""where does the tangle exist, and who organizes the tangle nodes"" was met with derision and a command of ""go do research scrub"". I stuck around, I did research, and I found out my problem, but I think that we need to be really cognizant of the fact that introducing tangle to a bitcoiner is like introducing a tesla to henry ford. Sure, henry knows better than the horse drawn carriage riding folks, but there are so many alien concepts with the tangle that it really tends to confuse people unless the right visualizations, and explanations are made for the newbies.  Some people really don't care and are throwing money at crypto like a monkey flinging poo at a wall, but I think that the majority of people do have some interest in assuring their money is kept safe. In normal business that means analyzing business models and understanding them. In crypto, that means analyzing protocol and understanding from a high level view what is going on.   What really allowed ethereum to take off was not simply the fact that erc20 tokens were a thing or that smart contracts were a thing. What allowed ethereum to take off was smart messaging and icos. Without that initial smart messaging that really conveyed how ethereum delivered on its promise, eth would still be $10\-$15 today. The hype train would have never lifted off. EVER. We need to model our community messaging to meet the same standards that the eth community had. From a tech standpoint, we are slightly superior to ETH, however we will NEVER beat their market cap if we have bad messaging.",Mitigating confusion

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvula9FiT\_U&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvula9FiT_U&amp;t)    Hey, Average Investor here. Today I wanted to talk about if I think a bear market would be good in the crypto space.   To start this off I think it is important to not think of this as FUD, but rather talking about a healthy market cycle. Also, you're within the 5&amp;#37; of the world using and investing into this technology, so you likely have a very bright future in this space.    Every year in any sort of market you're involved in you should expect a a correction. As well as about every 5 years for there to be a crash. Bear markets can typically last about a year, but obviously  this space is relatively new and unpredictable. But the important thing to note is that if you do sell, then you will lose. Fear and uncertainty in any space can lead you you making irrational decisions.  Maybe getting out of the market too soon, or maybe even putting in more than you can afford. As well as being too impatient on returns for an investment.     Diversity is extremely important to consider no matter what market you're entering. Always expect any investment you have to drop  50\-70&amp;#37; at any given time. Hedging funds into traditional assets like property, stocks, gold, silver etc can be very beneficial to minimize losses. As well as have a large diversity within your crypto assets.     While the market is down there are many things that can be very beneficial to investors. For starters you will have much more time to understand crypto itself. There are so many developing projects in this space it can be hard to wrap your head around all of them. Also, you can make sure that your projects your holding or planning to hold are showing real progress and real use. I have seen many new uses and updates on projects I am very interested in like civic, steem, and basic attention token. This time will allow many things such as EOS mainnet to come out, further development in things like golem, ada, and many others. As well as give time for more adoption to the lighting network and many more projects.     Another big thing a bear market will do is allow you a lot of time to accumulate. I personally always try and invest in bitcoin around $6k and lower. While this market has provided quite a few opportunities for that, I feel if it continues there will be more chances to accumulate around there. As well as allowing people with new interest or lower income to get involved without high premiums. I have a lot of friends getting into the space and I simply suggest to them to pull aside $10 every check and toss it into crypto to help get a  feel for the market. Which is not very risky as they may only have to give up two coffees to do it each paycheck. I also help them get started in investing with robinhood, which gives them a free stock starting out.

8636,0,"As far as I am concerned, the real issues around IOTA start when it moves towards 35c.  Right now, at $1.75 or whatever, one can see the risk - if you buy now you are probably going to make an 80% paper loss over the next 2-24 months. OK, there is a chance IOTA hits new ATHs within months, because of a dramatic change in sentiment, and that's why one holds what one is comfortable with. However at 35c it is a different story.  At that stage one might want to put serious money into IOTA, that one perhaps can't afford to lose.  If one is buying IOTA at 35c, I think one is going to be very scared.  Sentiment will be horrible, and there will probably be question marks about its whole survival.  So it really is going to be important to be able to quantify the risk.  It's not like a company, where you can see that the picture is getting better, perhaps because of good results against a backdrop of appalling sentiment.  This means one is really going to have to educate oneself as the crypto-space deflates, to decide whether it is worth taking serious risks further down the line.

8651,0,I've missed the $1 prices from early April. Buy up while cheap!!,Who else was happy to see $1.70 and buy more?
8652,0,"Hi everyone!  My first post here, so a little bit background. I started investing in crypto in early Nov 2017. My first holdings were actually IOTA, but also bought some Eth, Eos and Icx later on. After doing a lot of research I moved all in IOTA in Feb, maybe needles to tell you the reasons, but because I think that the other projects will be totally obsolete if IOTA comes even close to what they are aiming at.  I am a big believer in IOTA‚Äôs vision and having a huge respect for everyone who is putting their effort to make it happen. That said, as someone who has heavily invested in IOTA tokens I also have the investor point of view, where to me it only matters what will be the price of the token.  Now to the point. At the moment IOTA is totally following the price of Bitcoin like all the other altcoins. And I personally see no future for Bitcoin. Actually I believe it will crash down very hard in the long run and I think there is a good chance we may never see ath‚Äôs again. Kind of a dilemma for an investor today, because you basically need to believe in both of the projects today to justify your investment to yourself. So, the question is if there is any way to decouple from Btc?  Many say that we need to have more fiat pairing for being able to decouple. The way I see it, this has not done any good for other projects, they are all still more or less following Btc.   I believe there are only two options. One would be IOTA becoming #1, and maybe then everything would follow its price. This might happen in the mid term, but how low will Btc fall in the mean time? Other option, which I would favor, would be to remove IOTA from all the crypto exchanges and create a decentralized tangle based exchange with only iota fiat pairing.  How do you see this issue with IOTA following Btc and how could we decouple? Maybe Q will bring some way to exchange fiat directly to IOTA, so there would be no need for these currently shady centralized exchanges?",How to decouple from Btc?

8728,0,"So, I thought a small (opinionated) write-up on market psychology as it relates to the IOTA Foundation would be rather appropriate since I believe the crypto-market is an absolute crap-fest these days and may be for some time to come.  Okay... so the market is currently one where irrational, irresponsible, and downright wild speculation is the norm.  This is a fact that we know.  So, we need to look at the why:    First of all, let us look at the market participants:  I truly believe that the majority of the market is made up of, and forgive my use of this phrase, but ""stupid money"" (including myself to some extent).  So, what does that mean?  Well, to answer my own question... it means that there really isn't any (relatively speaking) institutional money in the game yet.  We are still stuck in a zone where specific groups, whales, and moonboys/girls control a lot of the volatility that we see.  In addition, the massive overreactions to FUD of all sorts further confirms that stupid, immature money is what the market is comprised of.  Okay, so what?  Good question... and the answer?  Well, we are still really early.  I am not even sure how early... one year, maybe two years, maybe five?  Not much help in deciding whether to invest or not, right?  Well, the good news is, I strongly believe (and yes, based on an insane amount of due diligence regarding the whole crypto-sphere, not my gut instinct) that if you are investing right now, regardless of the current markets ups and downs, you will be handsomely rewarded down the road.  The one caveat to that is, and this is important, CHOOSE WHAT YOU INVEST IN WISELY!  I emphasize that because I would estimate that possibly 90% or more (this is a guess based on the approximate overall number of crypto's out there currently) of all the projects out there right now will eventually fail or get eaten by the competition.  Okay, so there was my rant... but what about IOTA Foundation, right?  Well... the good news is, the IOTA Foundation and its roster of brilliant employees and advisers, along with its impressive list of growing multi-national partners, is in perfect position to not only survive, but thrive.  I could probably write a short book on how all the pieces fit together (referring to the advisers, employees, and companies involved with/in the success of the Foundation), or at least how I see it all making sense.  I'm not a particularly tech-savvy individual, but thanks to the reliable, honest individuals in the crypto-sphere (yes, there are some out there), I am able to confidently come to the conclusion that IOTA is the one of the best investments (long-term, maybe even short-term) in the crypto-sphere.    I truly believe once Q is revealed in a more detailed manner on June 3rd, we will be validated (and yes, it will be revealed on June 3rd... IF set that date knowing there is nothing holding them up and they could release that information today if they chose to).  I won't speculate in an in depth manner, but I believe that either Q, or some other tech announcement to follow, will allow MIOTA/IF to begin the process of decoupling (for lack of a better term) itself from the rest of the crypto-market.  I think this is key to long-term success.  Any crypto that wants to succeed needs to be able to stand on its own merits and not get dragged down or up by another unrelated technology.  The IF and its brilliant team know this and know that the price of the MIOTA is where they derive the majority of the Foundation's operating funds, which are essential to their survival and future growth.  Having said that, I can almost guarantee that we will be seeing the beginning of this separation process SOON!!!  That's right, I said it!  Anyway, hope everyone has a good day and don't let this irrational market stress you out.  Invest wisely and trust in the process.  We are getting closer everyday to a level playing field, where the best tech will win out.  Onward and upward.",Market Psychology: IOTA Foundation

I only logged 3 times total out of curiosity but it was a long time ago. Since, I just bought IOTAs on exchange and sent them to this address. I'm checking only the address with the Tangle explorer. Never logging directly in the wallet to avoid to use my seed. With the amount of people saying that their balance is 0, the snaptchot, previous history of people never logging and losing their IOTAs, here is my question: If i'm not logging for 10 years, as long as I have my seed (and the project is not dying), will I find back my IOTAs in 10 years? Or should I do something special? (sorry but all these posts of people losing their funds or aving 0 balance are confusing me)  2)Why are you guys logging into your wallet?

8790,0,"one of the few who still reads these?  &amp;nbsp;  I don't have to be PC so let me just say it how it is:  **Young naive writer https://twitter.com/AlyssaHertig gets handed narrative by the paper. Writes some stupid shit, gets paid by VC indirectly for protecting the portfolio (because IOTA is a threat to the entire portfolio). Slap a graphic on top of it. Done.**  I agree that there is no ""grand conspiracy"" to damage the IF. It's regular business for coindesk at this point.  https://www.coindesk.com/iota-2-7-billion-cryptocurrency-developers-love-hate/  &amp;nbsp;  Attacking IOTA on a scientific level ended with self inflicted academic fraud (allegedly), exposing bad actors and destroyed reputations, while educating the IOTA community about the protocol itself. If the media didn't spin the DCI/IOTA incident, it would have been an absolute PR bloodbath for DCI. **The new angle is: hurt the IF by making it look like a toxic environment for developers.**  That's why month old screenshots are being digged out. This is FUD with surgical precision because developers engaging with the IOTA protocol is one of the more underrated but really fucking important factors.  Thanks to the first steps in making the IF more transparent however, we now know over that 1300+ developers/creators are part of the Ecosystem. https://ecosystem.iota.org  &amp;nbsp;  **Yes, you should boycott Coindesk. No, it's not childish. You should generally avoid all bad press as it's a waste of time.**   &amp;nbsp;  If the first newspaper you‚Äôve read was on an iPad you might not know this: **Serious newspapers label articles, in which the writer states his/her opinion on the topic he/she is reporting on, AS SUCH.** Those are often referred to as ‚ÄúOpinion Pieces‚Äù or a ‚ÄúComment‚Äù. However...  &amp;nbsp;  **Most crypto news sites are simply a vehicle to push undisclosed native advertisement**  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_advertising  *[Native advertising is a type of advertising, mostly online, that matches the form and function of the platform upon which it appears.]* ...  *[a clear disclosure is deemed necessary when employing native marketing strategy in order to protect the consumer from being deceived]* ... *[According to Federal Trade Commission, means of disclosure include visual cues, labels, and other techniques.[8]]*  &amp;nbsp;  here is a good example of a native advertisement: https://www.coindesk.com/circle-adds-zcash-crypto-investment-app/  &amp;nbsp;   If a news outlet is NOT even labeling opinion pieces as such - it‚Äôs not worth your time. **It will add more confusion than clarity. Because that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs designed to do.**  Let's see if we can spot the difference between professional and fraud:  1. https://www.finder.com.au/fujitsu-showcases-iota-cryptocurrency-as-new-automation-standard &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 2. https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2018/04/28/iota-university-college-london-ucl/  see how finder.com.au is very clear about everything? Opinion and disclosure? TNW not so much...   ok, let's never talk about this again! Let's finally move on.  &amp;nbsp;   We should stay healthy skeptics towards corporate adoption. Friendly reminder the IF exists mainly to push back on corporate agendas.  For all we know, some just do it for the extra likes on twitter because of a #IOTA hashtag. Rarely do corporate SM accounts enjoy this kind of attention.  If you think i'm being anti-corporate libtardish, consider this: **Industry 4.0 needs IOTA more than IOTA needs them.** https://twitter.com/Schuldensuehner/status/989738856298659841 Not only to stay competitive but also to not get hacked and shut down by ‚Äúinsert country‚Äù. Bosch, Fujitsu and DXC are maybe the first to realize this. SO PLEASE stop begging on social media and tweeting at Elon Musk about IOTA. It‚Äôs not a good look.  &amp;nbsp;  that being said: &amp;nbsp;  **Institutional  money and regulation is the hot topic right now.** And most likely will be during 2018. BTC Futures showed a recent spike in Volume hinting at smart money flowing in: https://twitter.com/CryptoKinky/status/989569263383011328 (dont judge me for my resources i cant afford nice looking charts)  There are several news articles about WS traders moving to crypto and so on. **Looks like things are starting to get rolling in the institutional world, as infrastructure is being set up.**  Contrary to popular tinfoilery believe *(aka. ""The Cartel"" Medium Article, that all of Bitcoin is 100% manipulated already based on future contracts)*, futures had relatively small volume compared to the global btc volume - most likely not important enough to justify manipulation of the entire market.  https://bitcoinaverage.com/en/bitcoin-price/btc-to-usd (global volume)  &amp;nbsp;  Even the SEC Chairman Jay Clayton stated that futures market is ""quite small"" in his public statement before the february hearing:  https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opagiancarlo37  *It is important to put the new Bitcoin futures market in perspective. It is quite small with open interest at the CME of 6,695 bitcoin14 and at Cboe Futures Exchange (Cboe) of 5,569 bitcoin (as of Feb. 2, 2018). At a price of approximately $7,700 per Bitcoin,15 this represents a notional amount of about $94 million.*  &amp;nbsp;  If you believe in a paradigm shift, this means we are still early.  &amp;nbsp;  Recent regulatory voices and twitter drama led to this piece by https://coincenter.org/entry/no-ether-is-not-a-security  Why is this important? Companies in the US most likely are patient about making an investment into any crypto token as there is regulatory uncertainty.  DXC TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, showcased a PoC with IOTA. At Q4 in december, **DXC has stated**:   **213 Million in Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities.** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1688568/000168856818000007/dxc1231201710-q.htm  Just some food for thought:  If you are already spending opportunity cost on IOTA, why wouldn't you leverage that with the token. Bosch invested into the token as well, most likely because there is more regulatory certainty in germany. Fujitsu wants to roll out IOTA as an industry standard (as it seems). This is not your regular Shitcoin. **There is a reason dumb money is called dumb.** Last time i check Verge had 10x the volume on binance compared to IOTA.  &amp;nbsp;  There are no fundamentals yet in evaluation, it‚Äôs purely speculative - but with more institutions moving into the space this might change. As such, CCs with industrial use could likely see a reevaluation. But, looking in from the outside, there seem to be some hurdles.  this twitter account is one of the more resourceful ones, he lets out some numbers to boost his SM traction (god bless him) https://twitter.com/joel_john95  as outsiders, this will be an extremely helpful resource. He tweeted out a quarterly report https://medium.com/outlier-ventures-io/state-of-blockchains-q1-2018-1efe284572c1  he writes: **Over $1.8 billion has been invested into firms working with the blockchain ecosystem through corporate venture capital to date.**  That‚Äôs not that much. Is it. For the entire ecosystem? Friendly reminder snapchat, after a 20% fall, is a 15 billion company. Just to get some perspective.  &amp;nbsp;   Especially if you consider the crypto market is still in the hands of leveraged daytraders on bitmex and whales, who got big stacks in a coin early on.   Imagine you want to invest 3M into IOTA as a VCV, you would‚Äôt spin up binance and hit market order. You contact the IF and see if you can buy some, or outlier ventures might want to part with some, or even the founders i imagine hold quite a substantial amount.   I often see people asking for more exchanges - that's kinda missing the point. What you want at this point is more institutional interest. That's the kind of demand we want. Thats what you would call ""organic growth"" i guess.  Ripple holders, thinking a coinbase listening would make XRP go to $10, fail understand that Ripple itself holds a substantial amount of tokens where VCs can go and buy in bulk. And that‚Äôs why XRP is such a Shitcoin in the first place.   &amp;nbsp;  Cool thing about open ledgers is that you can look at them. Go figure. https://arewedecentralizedyet.com/  &amp;nbsp;  Ripple and XML look extremely bad with over 90% of coins held in the top 100 addresses (shitcoins confirmed). TRX and EOS don‚Äôt even have a mainnet yet to really track it - so you can imagine the numbers are likely shit too. ADA is looking way better than IOTA in terms of wealth distribution. But 60% for whales, IF and Founders is probably better than what most projects can show for.  Thing is, the small guys got in on crypto first. Not the banks, not a selected silicon valley investor boisclub either. While this is good for us, it's a nightmare for investment banks and such.   JPMorgan admitted that in their ‚ÄúBTC Bible‚Äù saying:  *Ownership is highly concentrated. The opportunity set around direct CC trading appears relatively limited for banks*   (Think about that for a second.)  CVC investing into the token could be, in my speculative opinion, the most likely catalyst for the price of IOTA, as its industrial adoption can build a synergy for entire sectors. As the main argument for Bitcoin is price uncorrelation to legacy assets, IOTA might be an interesting pick for the smart money, as it could be one of the few CCs with actual fundamental impact on different industry sectors. **Something Blockchain, after 10 years, has failed to do.**  Let me summarize because i was a bit all over the place. Things i will look for going forward:  1. Institutional infrastructure is being built as we speak as regulations get more clear 2. 2018 might see the highest investments into the blockchain ecosphere 3. Financial talent from legacy market is switching to crypto 4. Retail investors are the early adopters, not exclusive silicon valley boiclubs 5. Liquidity is really bad, its hard to buy a lot of crypto for institutions  6. The real FOMO and bubble might come with the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù money 7. IF addressing wealth distribution and being more transparent  (i do not have a finance background as you can see and i write these to offer some interesting links and resources you might find useful in your own research.)

8809,0,"At the end of last year, [iota¬†coin](https://citicoins.com/iota/) was up 100&amp;#37; overnight, reappearing the myth of cryptocurrency¬†creating wealth. It is even rumored on the Internet that a person spent $50, 000 in iota three years ago,Three years later, the man‚Äôs investment became 520,000 times the original amount.  The reason is that [iota price](https://citicoins.com/iota/) has risen from $0.00006 to $5.84 after two years of change.  Some people think that iota is comparable to bitcoin, but what is iota? I [define¬†iota](https://citicoins.com/iota/)¬†this way, First of all, iota is a technology that uses DAG to implement information transmission and to integrate cryptocurrency functions. Secondly, iota is a new transaction settlement and data transfer layer designed for the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)¬†on the basis of new distributed books.  For investors, the [iota value](https://citicoins.com/iota/) is more of their concern.Judging by the value of iota for a whole year, after the soaring price of iota last December, there has been no major increase. Looking at iota's dollar price list can know that although iota prices will not soar this week, but the upward trend is obvious. The price of iota yesterday has risen to the highest since 2018, but it has started to call back today. Therefore, there is a certain risk of rapid wealth by investing in iota, but long\-term holding is also likely to encounter iota coin price¬†skyrocketing opportunities.",Will IOTA soar after creating the myth of wealth?
8810,0,"I‚Äôm posting this because I believe IOTA will have a psychological advantage over other cryptos, currencies and tech.  Here‚Äôs a PDF of the book. http://radio.shabanali.com/predictable.pdf  The following are selected excerpts from chapter 3:  What is it about FREE! that's so enticing? Why do we have an irrational urge to jump for a FREE! item, even when it's not what we really want? I believe the answer is this. Most transactions have an up¬≠ side and a downside, but when something is FREE! we forget the downside, FREE! gives us such an emotional charge that we perceive what is being offered as immensely more valu¬≠ able than it really is. Why? I think it's because humans are intrinsically afraid of loss. The real allure of FREE! is tied to this fear. There's no visible possibility of loss when we choose a FREE! item (it's free). But suppose we choose the item that's not free. Uh-oh, now there's a risk of having made a poor decision‚Äîthe possibility of a loss. And so, given the choice, we go for what is free.  For this reason, in the land of pricing, zero is not just an¬≠ other price. Sure, 10 cents can make a huge difference in de¬≠ mand (suppose you were selling millions of barrels of oil), but nothing beats the emotional surge of FREE! This, the zero price effect, is in a category all its own. To be sure, ""buying something for nothing"" is a bit of an oxymoron....  Let me tell you a story that describes the real influence of FREE! on our behavior. A few years ago, Amazon.com started offering free shipping of orders over a certain amount. Some¬≠ one who purchased a single book for $16.95 might pay an additional $3.95 for shipping, for instance. But if the customer bought another book, for a total of $31.90, they would get their shipping FREE! Some of the purchasers probably didn't want the second book (and I am talking here from personal experience) but the FREE! shipping was so tempting that to get it, they were willing to pay the cost of the extra book. The people at Ama¬≠ zon were very happy with this offer, but they noticed that in one place‚ÄîFrance‚Äîthere was no increase in sales. Is the French consumer more rational than the rest of us? Unlikely. Rather, it turned out, the French customers were reacting to a different deal.  Here's what happened. Instead of offering FREE! shipping on orders over a certain amount, the French division priced the shipping for those orders at one franc. Just one franc‚Äî about 20 cents. This doesn't seem very different from FREE! but it was. In fact, when Amazon changed the promotion in France to include free shipping, France joined all the other countries in a dramatic sales increase. In other words, whereas shipping for one franc‚Äîa real bargain‚Äîwas virtu¬≠ ally ignored by the French, FREE! shipping caused an enthu¬≠siastic response.  America Online (AOL) had a similar experience several years ago when it switched from pay-per-hour service to a monthly payment schedule (in which you could log in as many hours as you wanted for a fixed $19.95 per month). In preparation for the new price structure, A O L geared up for what it estimated would be a small increase in demand. What did it get? An overnight increase from 140,000 to 236,000 customers logging into the system, and a doubling of the average time online. That may seem good‚Äîbut it wasn't good. AOL's customers encountered busy phone lines, and soon AOL was forced to lease services from other online providers (who were only too happy to sell bandwidth to AOL‚Äîat the premium of snow shovels in a snowstorm). What Bob Pittman (the president of AOL at the time) didn't realize was that consumers would respond to the allure of FREE! like starving people at a buffet.   When choosing between two products, then, we often overreact to the free one. We might opt for a FREE! checking account (with no benefits attached) rather than one that costs five dollars a month. But if the five-dollar checking account includes free traveler's checks, online billing, etc., and the FREE! one doesn't, we may end up spending more for this package of services with the FREE! account than with the five-dollar account. Similarly, we might choose a mortgage with no closing costs, but with interest rates and fees that are off the wall; and we might get a product we don't really want simply because it comes with a free gift....  So you can maintain the status quo with a 20-cent fee (as in the case of Amazon's shipping in France), or you can start a stampede by offering something FREE! Think how powerful that idea is! Zero is not just another discount. Zero is a dif¬≠ ferent place. The difference between two cents and one cent is small. But the difference between one cent and zero is huge!  If you are in business, and understand that, you can do some marvelous things. Want to draw a crowd? Make some¬≠ thing FREE! Want to sell more products? Make part of the purchase FREE!  Similarly, we can use FREE! to drive social policy. Want people to drive electric cars? Don't just lower the registration and inspection fees‚Äîeliminate them, so that you have cre¬≠ ated FREE! In the same way, if health is your concern, focus on early detection as a way to eliminate the progression of severe illnesses. Want people to do the right thing‚Äîin terms of getting regular colonoscopies, mammograms, cholesterol checks, diabetes checks, and such? Don't just decrease the cost (by decreasing the co-pay). Make these critical proce¬≠ dures FREE!  I don't think most policy strategists realize that FREE! is an ace in their hand, let alone know how to play it. It's cer¬≠ tainly counterintuitive, in these times of budget cutbacks, to make something FREE! But when we stop to think about it, FREE! can have a great deal of power, and it makes a lot of sense.",The Cost of Zero Cost

8895,0,"Hi Everyone,  I know that people are upset about the IOTA Foundation's ETA's and deadlines and so on and so forth, but let's just all be reasonable and calm down.  Take a few deep breaths and realize that they are working as diligently as they can on all of the items they have in the pipeline and deadlines really should not be obsessed over to the extent that I have seen.  I came over to the crypto-sphere (end of December unfortunately) from day/swing trading strictly in traditional markets and I must say that I was shocked at the overall atmosphere and attitudes of most participants (at least based on Reddit and other similar platforms). Fortunately I came across the IOTA community and I felt that we were more reserved and reasonable, and I still do believe that we are.  Having said that, I believe we need to just support the IF and the team as they work on making a massive, absolutely incredible vision and concept come to life. Yes, it will take time, but I have a strong feeling in my gut (based on due diligence concerning everything IOTA) that this project will be life changing, more or less, for those that continue to trust and believe in the IF team.  Honestly, I understand the frustration, but if we cannot be patient for several months (I'm not even talking years), then I believe the issue is us and not the IF. Why not just go live the rest of your life and not let the ETA's and deadlines of the IF control your existence (I'm exaggerating a little of course).  Anyway, I just want to leave everyone with this:  Yes, I am a nobody in the grand scheme of things, and my opinion is just that, but let's just try to maintain our composure as a community and be a strong community (which is rare in the crypto-sphere) and just continue to trust and support the IF team even if they miss supposed deadlines and ETA's by days or weeks or months. I promise you they are working hard and, for those of us holding significant stacks of MIOTA's, we will be rewarded handsomely.  I hope everyone has a good day and continues to feel as excited about this project as I do.  Take care!",Keep Calm Brothers and Sisters!

8908,0,Is active trading open here? Can you deposit and withdrawal iota? What are the fees like?,Hitbtc . Iota .
8909,0,"I've been working on this software for over 5 months now, and as a college student who's trying to use projects for future career prospects, I've decided to keep it free for everyone. I'm curious whether people are interested in an app like this. Currently, my app is able to find arbitrage opportunities between **Binance** **Bittrex** **Bitfinex** **HitBTC** **OKEx** **Poloniex** **Kraken** **HitBTC** **Huobi** **BitStamp** **GDAX** and **Bit-Z**.  My app is unique in that it works not only by calculating the profit from buying on one exchange and selling on another, but it also considers other things like trading volume to filter out poor options, so you don't waste your time on an arbitrage opportunity that only works with 10$ before the prices begin to converge.   When engaging in arbitrage, you're able to significantly lower your risk by keeping your money out of the tumultuous markets for as long as possible, which was a major idea in mind while designing this software. The purpose of CryptArbitrage is to detect when large price differences between different exchanges pop up and immediately capitalize off it, which allows you to keep your money out of the tumultuous markets for as long as possible, sharply reducing your risk -- the only risk is the time it takes to transfer from your coins from exchange A to exchange B. However, ERC20 tokens have become quite quick and have low transfer fees, so my app works well with most digital currencies.  I'm curious about how many people have been able to successfully profit from arbitrage and also who would be interested in such a system. Especially now that iota is so fast, it is really not as risky as other coins. Right now, there are opportunities for ~5.0% gains.  The app is called ""CryptArbitrage"" on the Google Play Store, I'm keeping it free and adless for everyone. --------TRY IT OUT-----------------  Edit: Here is a link if you guys want https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=my.awesome.project.cryptarbitrage30 Ignore the lame id :)  Edit: Here is the code if you want to check it out:  https://github.com/alexkoby/CryptArbitrage/",I Built An Crypto Arbitrage Detector And It Notices Iota Trading ~5% Higher On Gate.io Than OKEx

Thank you","Can someone explain to me why the fuck IOTA is in the red today, while almost every other crypto is in green?"
8913,0,"IOTA   **Problem: Scalability**:  The big issue with Bitcoin has become quite evident, scalability due to transactions taking hours and days to confirm. What this hinted was that with growing adoption, it would take longer to process transactions because the number of transactions a blockchain can handle can never exceed the number of network nodes.  **Solution:** Unlike blockchain where transactions are arranged chronologically, IOTA runs a Tangle system. By this it means each new transaction must first assemble any two transactions that came before it, and attach a proof of work to it.     **Problem: Fees:**  Transaction fees are bound to increase (and become outrageous) when the network becomes clogged.   **Solution:** The tangle system of IOTA has made it such that there are zero transaction fees.   **What is it?:**  * IOTA is underlying technology is called Tangle, not a Blockchain * IOTA has no mining, no blocks, no difficulty * IOTA has no transaction fees * IOTA scales almost infinitely, unlike Blockchains * IOTA has no mining, no blocks, no transaction fees.  * The security and consensus of the network is not divided among miners, validators, and users. * Users of the network validate two old transactions (via proof of work) in order to be able to conduct one of their own.  * No one receives a reward and no one has to pay transaction fees.  * A miner-centralization like in Bitcoins or in Ethereums network is, therefore, not possible.  **Use/Integration example:**  The foundation is aiming to establish the IOTA token as the standard solution for m2m payments between IoT devices.  For example, your car will have a wallet to automatically pay for each meter it drives on a highway (the instant ""pay by unit"" is possible through the IOTA Flash network). It could also pay for parking and refueling and privileges such as driving in the wind shadow of other cars. (credits to Redditor Lucyseediamonds for this example)   **MARKET CAP AND 24 HOUR VOLUME**  IOTA has a very good market capitalization of about 6 Billion USD. If we look at 24 hour volume we can see that it fluctuates between 20million-90million. This is a good indicator that even at lows, there is still a substantial amount being moved. Currently trading at price of $1.91. I'm not one comment on an exact price to buy as I think investments should be made with a long-term mindset. I know Apollo Investments will be releasing their 2Q picks and I think this might be a contender. https://www.facebook.com/groups/apolloinvestments/ But that being said there is a lot of competition.   **Coins Supply**  Whenever you decide to pick a coin for long term or even short term trade, you must have a look at coins supply. IOTA has a total supply of 2.77 Billion and all the coins supply is circulating in the market.  **Availability**  No matter how much good project a cryptocurrency has, it should be available to greater public by getting listed on different crypto exchanges. IOTA is listed on a lot of big exchanges and I am sure more will come in the next few months. I skimmed through a few articles and supposedly IOTA will be released on Cobinhood within the next couple weeks.   Also, Im curious, who here bought into IOTA and at what price? Im actually not holding any myself but I am thinking about adding it to my portfolio.   ***Also Cobinhood has to be one of the worst names in crypto.

8967,0,"Hello dear Iota hodlers! First time reddit posting of my life! Here we go  Background: first introduced to crypto early last year, found out about iota in may and was mesmerised by its vision. Bought iota when it first got listed on bitfinex at 50 cents, watched it fall to 17 cents, then rise to 5.80, and then back all the way to 90 cents a week ago and proud to say I hodled strong, not sold a single iota yet :D  I believe Iota will be worth AT LEAST 10 dollars by June and here is why:  1. I have been trading bitcoins and etherum the last one year with mixed successess (i would never risk trading my precious iotas haha) and I recently, personally called bitcoin bottoming out at around 6k (yes i have no evidence to back this statement up, but i REALLY did, and i'm quite proud to see this recent trend reversal). And I see bitcoin topping out at 16k in another month or two (x2 roughly from here) and I predict iota to reflect this bitcoin movement, pushing its price up at least another x3 if not more to roughly $5 dollars before Trinity/Q comes out. I think Trinity and Q being delayed was the BEST thing to happen to iota purely in terms of price because it would be so much more amazing for Q to push the price up multiple folds when iota is worth $5 as opposed to $1  2. I feel that unlike the other altcoins, iota is where the 'smart' investors have put their money into. Iota isn't like your other classic altcoins that is readily available in every exchange. It takes research and effort to buy into iota and I dont see why ANY of us would sell iota when there's SOOOOOOO much good news in the horizon (IXI, Trinity, Q, Adoption) - this probably explains why iota was able to grow from 90 cents to $2.2 in less than 2 weeks while bitcoin only rose from $7900 to $9200 in that time frame  3. Having said point 2, imagine if one BIG exchange in korea (Bithumb or Upbit) decides to list Iota. Currently, the korean exchange that lists iota (Coinone) is such a small volume exchange, I dont feel they appreciate Iota as much as they should (nobody in korea seems to even be aware of Q). We could potentially expect another healthy 50% climb in price if this happens in the next 2 months, bringing in a surge of fresh fiat, putting iota at $7 before Q is released. And this isn't necessarly delusional as Bithumb and Upbit has recently started to go into fierce competition between each other by listing coins that the other party doesn't already have for market dominance (and yes, iota is the only coin in the top 20 that both exchanges dont already have listed)  4. If the above 3 points come true, and iota sits comfortably at, say, $5 (which is my own personal prediction) before the release of Q, I dont see why $10 is not a realistic target goal for iota in terms of price by June. I personally think we'll temporarily spike well beyond the 10 dollar mark :P  Please excuse me if I sound like a delusional moon boy, but Iota recently has got me so excited and pumped, and I am a true believer of everything i said!!!!!!! LET'S HODL STRONG TOGETHER EVERYONE!!! GLGL IOTA!",June Price Prediction

However there is a very high chance that this is a dead cat bound, in which case $3 would seem a good place to sell.  As soon as there is turmoil in the world markets, cryptos will get smashed.  But is there an alternative scenario?  Once BTC goes over $20,000, or IOTA over $6, for example.  Perhaps the markets will have once last hurrah... but how high can IOTA go in the short-term, in other words in 2018?  If BTC can lead the pack, can there be another wall of money entering the space?  Is $25 achievable by the end of the year - which might be the case if the current rally moves through into ATHs?

8986,0,"Somehow this post was removed from IOTA subreddit and they say I shall repost it here:  In the last weeks more posts about utility and DApps on IOTA were asked on IOTA subreddit. The answers ranged from second layer ideas to some half baked answers which left the reader unsatisfied. I work in a software environment and want to give you an overview how I and others which I spoke to see the future of distributed ledger technology \(DLT\) and IOTA. I am not a fan of second layers and will give you an approach how this can be solved.  First lets start what IOTA is right now and what it wants to accomplish as basic as possible: IOTA wants to be a data and value transfer protocol. The protocol aims to be fast, scalable, highly decentralized and feeless. If this works out you have real new technology which is unique in this space. It is highly specialized but good and maybe the best in what it will doing. There are still  uncertainties and critical parts, like coordinator and random network validation but I am positive the IOTA foundation will  solve it in the one or other way. Therefore IOTA should focus and prioritize these aims in order to be the backbone of DLT. DLT tech is revolutionary and WILL open new markets. Just think about it, right now the data transfer is feeless but also has zero value attached to it. Also data in databases can easily be manipulated by humans without the transperancy. With the new internet of value, new markets will emerge. Exchange/transform an asset into a different kind of asset. E.g. exchange data =\&gt; fiat=\&gt;  fuel/electricity=\&gt; carbon emission.  So now we know the basics of IOTA and one usecase what is still missing for this usecase and the next generation of internet? Lets take a step back and think about how the internet is workng right now: On a basic level we have servers, clients and a message protocol. Servers \(where e.g. the websites are stored\) are in a big network with each other. As a client we can request and send data with the message protocol to the servers. The server will process the data and can give an answer back. If we use this analogy and apply it to distributed ledger technology, what we have is:  Transfer Protocol:  Value transfer protocol like IOTA/?...  Server \- Client connection:  DApp plattforms like ETH/NEO/VeChain,....  Server \- Server connections: Interoperability networks like ICX/AION/,....   IOTA does not natively provide a dapp and virtual machine architecture. I think this is GOOD in some way. IOTA should prioritze and focus on the points I mentioned earlier and therefore it needs to be highly optimized. You cannot build a virtual machine architecture in the transfer protocol without any downsides in speed or scalability! And here comes the interobperability networks into play. These networks \(like ICX\) will have the option to switch between these ledger technologies. With this, the new internet can pick the best networks for each category. E.g. connect the best transfer protocol with the best dapp network. And just because of this reason, interoperability WILL be big and NEEDED.  I want to give you an usecase to imagine it better:  In not so distant future I drive to a party. I stop right before the club, step out of my car and give the car the command to refuel and find a parking spot by itself. The car \(connected through other cars through DLT, constantly exchanging road data\) drives autonomous to the next fuel station.  A DApp \(e.g. on ETH network\) now sets the contracts between the fuel station and the car. Since I have set the amount how much I want to spent on fuel beforehand, the car will only use this amount. First, the DApp provides the carbon emission data to your government/insurance \(only if you set it up and therefore by sending this data you will reduce your tax/insurance\). Afterwards the DApp connects to the interoperability network \(like ICX\) which on the other hand is connected to IOTA and a stable coin/fiat network. Another DApp on the ICX network checks if the fuel station is trustworthy by asking different supply chain business platforms \(like VeChain\). Also it looks up if there are any cyber security problems with the station through e.g. Sentinel protocol. If these checks are ok the main payment process can begin.  With IOTA you can bill the fuel to the split second and pay with a stable coin/fiat without much volatility. Meanwhile I can check the wherabouts of my car and what happened to it. The car then drives to the next parking spot and can finally rest there until I give the command to pick me up at the club. There are a lot of business usecases still waiting for to be discovered. But before we can implement and create a new internet, we still have a long way before us until the technology is ready for mass adoption.  SUMMARY  Lets not be hostile against other crypto projects \(ok there are exceptions; I admit I think XVG is not scam but still shtcoin because of bad coding and developer; there are still a lot of wannabe developers out there in DLT\) and work together on the next generation of internet. IOTA foundation can and will not reshape the internet alone BUT in combination with other DLT projects! I hope the IOTA foundation and other projects recognize it and work together instead of fighting each other.  PS.: Normally I charge for these types of analysis a lot \(of course more indepth and with more numbers;\-\)\), but this time I wanted to give something back to the community since you helped me to get started into crypto. And this thread ismy opinion and no investment advice. Invest on your own risk.",How interoperability WILL be a feature of next DLT and what role IOTA plays in it

9071,0,"There are many stories of people earning a lot with crypto and finally losing even more because of taxes. Especially because of taxes on trades:  -2017: I bought 10 BTC for $10,000 each ($100,000 total).  -BTC is now $20,000 (now worth $200,000). I traded it all for ETH: I realized $100,000 in profits, and owes tax on that.  -Then the 2017 tax year ends. We are in 2018 and ETH drops 50%.   -I'm back at my original $100,000 of value but I still owe tax on $100,000 profit in 2017. At 40% tax rate, I owe $40,000 in tax, despite not withdrawing anything to USD. Because of the volatility, I lost a lot.  What are the solutions? Holding and that's it? Even if... there are still strong taxes at the end.   Is there any good strategy?  ",How to reduce taxes with IOTA?
9072,0,"The only cryptocurrency that I am interested in holding is Iota. And one of the few regrets I have was back in the fall of last year, to purchase Iota I would first buy ETH off coinbase, and just use it to trade to immediately get more iotas. However, at one point in time `ETH` was worth 3x iota and I didn't have any in holdings.   Remembering that I put about 40% of my iota holdings into ETH in case that happened again to get more iota. The problem is when I converted my iota to eth it was when the iota/eth value pair was at `.0019` which is very low. At the time I had no idea. I was just looking at the raw number value when the market was declining and figured they were about even.   When I look at the trend line over the last 6 months or so the average value is around `.0020` to `.0021`. Currently the value is `.002905` on https://www.cryptocompare.com/coins/iot/overview/ETH as a result have lost quite a few Iotas.   It seems like the value is continuing to trend up, is it likely the iota/eth value will eventually regress back toward the average so that I can recover these lost iotas? Part of of me is feeling a bit of panic as I see the ratio trend up, and I think just trade now and take a loss and learn your lesson in case it goes higher and stays there. The other part of me says to wait and be patient and you can probably recover most of what you lost if it regresses back to the average. ",Waiting on Iota/ETH Value to recover

9079,0,"In my first shitshow post i told you guys about the paradigm shift. Then i talked about the importance of nonprofits in said shift and that **no** privately owned company will play an important role in it. I then digged out some possible third VC that IOTA has, in response to shit being talked online about IOTA.  Then verge pumped because of a Tweet that you need to donate for a partnership...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1U1PM-p3860  &amp;nbsp;  **Verge is a 1B Cryptocurrency** while IOTA is about 2B.. it does make you wonder how that can be. Now before we start to dig into things let me make it clear that i have no formal education on finance or economics. If you do, you probably should skip this one. Also, if you invest based on this Thread, it is only fair that you lose all your money because you are a dumbass.   &amp;nbsp;  It's almost impossible to value cryptos. ""There is no Fundamentals"" - is what a legacy market guy would tell you. As we learned in one of my other posts, the IF itself doesn't even need to issue public financial statements (which in my opinion it should do).  What we can do however compare different ledgers and or research projects against each other. So let's go back to Verge. Verge is a Shitcoin. IOTA is not. If you agree with that you come to the following conclusion: **Either the altcoin market will still have to fall about 95% in value to follow common sense or IOTA is highly undervalued.** Or maybe IOTA is a bit overvalued and others have to fall more or.... you get my point.  &amp;nbsp;  First things first: Bitcoin is here to stay. It is not an altcoin and it won't be one for a long time. Bitcoin can exist as a store of value alone - it does not need the ""buying coffee"" use case bitcoin maximalists can't shut up about.  https://twitter.com/MacroScope17/status/961622167048859648  &amp;nbsp;  If you are using Bitcoin to provide a negative before telling people why IOTA can do everything better you are lost in the woods. I know this is a very popular narrative among IOTA aficionados and this might be hard for you to hear.  Yes, having a DAG without mining is wonderful - but using energy to secure a public ledger is not the dumbest thing in the world. As of now, IOTA is nowhere near being called immutable. This will take time.  If you are relatively new to cryptos in general, most likely joined last year or during this years peak - do not fall into that line of thinking. That for IOTA to grow, Bitcoin needs to vanish. Try to think for yourself.  And read the following Article:  https://medium.com/@vijayboyapati/the-bullish-case-for-bitcoin-6ecc8bdecc1  &amp;nbsp;  SHUT UP ABOUT BITCOIN. Okey, jesus. I'm sorry. I needed to make this point so i can talk shit about ""Blockchain"" and how it all ties together.  As a non-developer, after a while, ""Blockchain"" is probably the most boring, stagnant tech i can think of. It's almost as boring as Smartphones only getting a tiny bit bigger and shatter more easily when you drop them. Imho, ""Bitcoin"" is the only interesting thing about ""Blockchain"".  Today, ""Blockchain"" is so irrelevant that **in 2018 Vitalik Buterin still publishes Text on centralized servers which are, big surprise, NOT censorship resistant**  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_(website) https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin  **""As of June 2017, Medium has been blocked in Egypt along with more than 60 online media websites in a crackdown by the Egyptian government.""**  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  Amazing.   &amp;nbsp;  Friendly reminder ETH was supposed to be THE web 3.0. Most people seem to ignore that or they never figured because of what they are presented with. Sure there is a roadmap, sharding this and that, but if i'm getting excited about future theoretical improvements on a protocol, im excited about IOTA. Simple.  &amp;nbsp;  With this in mind: The EU is at it again!  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/european-countries-join-blockchain-partnership  *""In the future, all public services will use blockchain technology. Blockchain is a great opportunity for Europe and Member States to rethink their information systems, to promote user trust and the protection of personal data, to help create new business opportunities and to establish new areas of leadership, benefiting citizens, public services and companies. The Partnership launched today enables Member States to work together with the European Commission to turn the enormous potential of blockchain technology into better services for citizens"".*  &amp;nbsp;  This circlejerk from politicians is about 4 years too late. **One can only hope that by ""Blockchain"" they simply use it as the buzzword it has degenerated into.**  It is however nice to see the EU is starting to befriend distributed ledgers, they even fund privacy research on the chain: *It will use blockchain technology to create tools that will give people ownership of the data which they and the devices they own generate, in order to respond to concerns about losing control of personal information on the internet.*  they go on and say that:  *Currently, four pilot projects are being developed in Amsterdam and Barcelona, focused on the themes of the Internet of Things, open democracy and the sharing economy.*  &amp;nbsp;  Ok so.. Blockchain and IoT? Sure bro.  https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/blockchain-give-people-more-control-about-their-data  &amp;nbsp;  Lets go one step back. How much money does the EU spend on research for this in total and how does it compare to the IOTA Foundation?  **22 European countries plan to have allocated a total of 380M Euro by the end of 2020.**  Let's compare this to the IF. Get ready for some quick maffs.  the IF received 5% of the total supply as donations. In addition to that the Ecosystem fund holds another 21T (correct?!). At the current price, ignoring VC hoarding, ignoring lawyers, salaries etc. **the IF is worth about 220M Dollar .**  Ya know. Plus minus tens of millions.  In my very humble opinion: those countries probably are well advised to get in contact with the IF (if they aren't already).  &amp;nbsp;  So. What if the price of **1 Miota drops to 50Cents? The Ecosystem Fund would still value 10M to support innovation** around the tangle. This holds up very well versus the 2 years 5M program the EU has going, building tools for privacy on top of Blockchain.  It should peak everyone's interest how this plays out. And how much the IF is involved here.  So.. is a 2B Market Cap still absurd for IOTA? I really **hope** it is NOT. **Because the current MC gives the IF the possibility to rival the research incentives of 22 European countries.**   &amp;nbsp;  Why did i go on about Bitcoin in the beginning. You see: as long as IOTA is traded against Bitcoin, you have two different $ prices attached to it. If 1 Miota is worth 17k satoshi, the price of satoshis dictates the price of Iota. One often ignored fact is that Binance overtook Finex in volume the past few weeks (ignoring the fact here that most volume on Binance is fake). But still, in a market where (as of today) Bitcoin has 44% Market Share and IOTA a measly 1%, it is naive to think any kind of ""decoupling"" will happen anytime soon unless these numbers change. The best MIOTA can do is to **outperform** Bitcoin with a steady uptrend. This would be best case scenario.   https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/iota/#markets &amp;nbsp;  The available funds of the IF, especially the Ecofund, is in direct correlation to the bitcoin price - if you like it or not. So lets be careful what we wish for.",spec shitshow #4

Overall, cryptos are a risk-on asset, and as uncertainty comes into the overall market I would expect further selling pressure.

Here goes...  Ralph Rottmann says Q is a intersection of maths, crypto, decentralized computing, and IOTA. Details are hard to comprehend, and its not just a vm smoking gas.   Q is not just a vm. Well, that's nice, but what does that mean? Well, ethereum is a turing complete machine, however its contracts are expensive to run, and ethereum itself has a bottleneck of transactions per second. Second ""smoking gas"" this new IOTA computation model will probably be free.   Qis also an intersection of crypto, maths decentralized computing and iota. when ralph says crypto, there are two meanings- cryptography and cryptocurrencies. This is a key phrase, because if it is related to cryptocurrencies, then Q is a decentralized marketplace of some sort. However, Dominik has always been about data, and iota is just a cryptocurrency that the data can be traded for in his vision.   Ok, so if its cryptography, and not cryptocurrency, then that means the cryptography is securing some sort of data. But, we also have the addition of the term maths and not in relation to crypto. Also, iota is the chosen arbiter of price in this system, dom would never give that role to say litecoin.  All that said, It's not JUST a VM (so its some sort of computation thing) It is decentralized computing, it is some pretty difficult to understand math, and it is protected by cryptography and priced in iota.   I think that Q is a new programming language. This programming language runs on an iota virtual machine. This virtual machine dedicates computation tasks (threads if you will) to a set of computers on the network. Furthermore, this q module automatically verifies that the computation is accurate, either through some sort of market system of checks/balances or through the Q programming language dynamically verifying computation, and uploading run results to the tangle for validity checking. If this is what Q is, then iota just blew every single decentralized computing system (including ethereum) out of the water.   Right now, there are some virtual world dapps. They will migrate to iota because of Q. Smart contracts might stay in eth land, but all of the actual computation will be done on iota. Because both eth and iota are vms, an iota Q software bundle could publish to an eth contract. Ethereum is trying hard to meet its scaling problem via sharding, plasma, and proof of stake. The problem with that is that Ethereum will end up with lots of split child blockchains, and eth will end up as the arbitrator. Ok, great, but that means an even higher learning curve for any dev. Much respect to vitalik, but not everyone has his talent. Dom's system if it is truly a new programming language makes the bottleneck that plasma+sharding is trying to solve on eth... obsolete. Also, this means that secure trusted computing can occur on a decentralized insecure system. Something else to think about- there is something called homomorphic encryption. It allows a computer system to perform logical operations on encrypted data without decrypting it. Its an existing technology and if its incorporated into Q... well damn. He just blew amazon web services away in the area of trust.  So, let's talk price of an iota. If this is what Q is, I think that iota will hit #3 in marketcap within 48 hours. That is around $9.  However, we will start voraciously ripping out and devouring chunks of ethereum marketshare. I am pretty sure that within 1-2 weeks of Q release, eth is going to have a reckoning as investors begin to realize that all of eth's bottlenecks are gone on iota. Furthermore, we will probably see several large ethereum projects retooling themselves to also work on iota in the months after that. At that point, Iota will have a very valid reason to be listed on coinbase.   We could be seeing $50 iota by end of year. ",Q

Yes, I put my money here, and the expectations of seeing a world transformed by this formidable project. But in no way will I pretend to be making some kind of effort similar to that of the team. I give credit to every believer and investor. But to be fully honest, the front page and the triple-A letters deserve those who are in active work every day. Developing, devising, managing, organizing, and promoting. You have tried to imagine the agitation behind the scenes of those minds that every day are line upon line composing code, working algorithms, use cases, software, and those that are doing the organizational tasks of an entity that already has international reach. Yes, as you read it. (International). I believe that the vast majority of IOTA believers receive more than we actually give. Thing that having already presented almost all my argument is not difficult to accept ... I think. Having said that, I encourage you to see things as they really are. Without pretending to be good here, I only say that you make an effort and embrace patience, good cheer, common sense and consideration. These are things that I have also been learning.

9116,0,"I recently joined reddit, and thought I‚Äôd give a first impression by posting an observation as food for thought:  I‚Äôve searched around this and other similar pages, and found an enormous number of unsettled folks.  Perhaps reddit has a selection bias towards young people that are more accustomed to constant feedback, but even so, there is a palpable ‚Äúare we there yet?‚Äù mentality that I believe is counterproductive to being a successful investor.  Now, before I continue, I have to admit, I am not an institutional investor - less a ‚Äúwhale‚Äù than a healthy sea lion or small walrus (and no, I‚Äôm not fat, just big boned).  But, I‚Äôve had some success, and studied those who are successful over the long run, and the conclusion is this: almost always, the slowest, least sexy investment strategies are the most lucrative.  Finding an undervalued asset, investing incrementally, and holding a very long time (read: longer than whatever you are currently planning for), is by far the most reliable approach.  Checking social media every six minutes and staring at TA charts all day may seem productive or valuable, but in almost all cases, it‚Äôs a complete waste.  And I really do mean almost all cases.  Consider that the most sophisticated Wall Street firms, with high frequency trading abilities, and rooms full of mathematical prodigies, still only manage to eek out a small advantage over an index fund in the long run.  Obviously a small advantage can add up, but most firms make a killing on commissions/fees and other derivatives (of questionable value), not by being market oracles.  I guess all of this might be extremely obvious and boring to many of you, but remember: if you think IOTA is undervalued (as I do), buy as much as you are willing to lose over a pre-planned period of time, and go do something valuable/enjoyable with your time.  I truly regret wasting an uncountable number of hours of my life before I realized trying to ‚Äúbeat the market‚Äù is not only extremely time consuming and nerve-wracking, it‚Äôs almost impossible to do.   PS - If you disagree with everything I said, and/or are going to ignore all my advice anyway, checkout IOTA‚Äôs volume.  Since it‚Äôs consistently and significantly lower on bearish trends than most other top coins, you could infer that there are a large number of holders (like me) and a smaller proportion of anxiety-prone, chart-chasers (like you).  So, when people start selling, things seem worse than they really are.  Conversely, when people start piling in (think some big news breaking), there will be far more holders who aren‚Äôt willing to sell, which will drive the price up dramatically.  You will not be able to ‚Äúget in‚Äù in time, because it will spike too quickly for you to catch (there goes your perfectly calculated ‚Äúentrance point‚Äù‚Ä¶and all your profit).  Of course this bit of TA could be all wrong too, but you probably wouldn‚Äôt know the difference anyhow.  So seriously, get off of reddit, quit jerking it to that Lamborghini poster of yours, and go do something more valuable with your life (like stroking to a traditional Bukkake like a true gentleman who values his time).

So, I keep my seed on a CD-ROM. There was one seed I used initially to play around with day trading and as a result the first 6-7 addresses on this seed got used. I didn't want to re-attach 7 times every time there was a snapshot just to see my balance. So I just transferred all the remaining IOTA to an address on a new seed and threw away the disc with the old seed.  Anyways, since I don't want to risk putting the CD-Rom containing my seed into my computer all the time, I just have a text file with several receiving addresses so that when I buy, I can deposit my IOTA without inserting my seed disc.  I had been saving up for a while to buy some more IOTA and had over $900 designated for this buy. Long story short, I accidentally sent it to a receiving address for the disc I had thrown away. Fuck!  So it's gone, unless I can remember what the seed was. I'm pretty sure there were some 9s. :-(  Looking at that address in the tangle explorer is killing me.

9174,0,"Hi,  we have seen a nice ATH and a huge drop. But now it is the time to think about the what-ifs. Many of you have got loans from the bank or friends. So now think about what if the price rises 10x or 100x this year? This is my personal list (based on &gt; 10Gi and every step needs about 1-2 years):  FIRST) Pay back all your loans/debts with about 10-25% of your tokens. My free-of-loan-price would be at about $50 per Mi. And this price is already setup at the exchange I am on. Your life will be much more easy than it is now.  Second) Passiv income for all basic needs: food, rent for the flat, energy, communication. I will buy a house with tenants in it. They pay the rent and I can pay all my monthly bills. ~ 1-2 Gi at 150$-300$ per Mi.  At this point I am free to choose to work or not to work AND I still have a pretty large amount of iotas left ... now longterm investing:  First) Search for an investment with a steady output in the range of 3-5% per year for 10 or 20 years. Really longterm. At this time 1-2 Gi might be enough to generate a normal worker income of $30k-$50k per year. Now you can do whatever you want even if your house burns down.  Second) From now on invest 10% per year in gold, boring stocks (like nVidia, Tesla, ...), more flats, ... If you stay at 10% per year then it will take nearly forever before you have no iotas left.  What about your Lambo? If you really wanna have one then buy a used one (2-3 years old) from the 10% yearly. But it think with all the passive income you will not really need it. You can live everywhere on the planet and have partys all day long and the money is still coming in without any work. But you CAN work one whatevery project you want ... like building your own Lambo ;)   Prices based on this article:  https://theindependentrepublic.com/2018/01/29/new-iota-miota-wallets-are-here-to-make-your-life-easier/  ""Dom Schiener: ‚Äúwe will either be a trillion dollar project or nothing‚Äù.

I have been a holder of XRP for 8 months now.    I just thought I would post here as while the entire market is way down, I bought some IOTA for the first time last night.  I did not want to buy more XRP as I have plenty, but IOTA has been on my radar for quite some time.  Given $1 prices, it was too good to pass up.  There seems to be **a lot** of potential with the project.    I plan on picking up some more IOTA, but given the market could continue to go down, I am dollar cost averaging so it will likely not be for another few days.

9188,0,,IOTA-Based √¢¬Ä¬òE-Krona√¢¬Ä¬ô Cryptocurrency To Be Launched By Sweden
9190,0,It doesn‚Äôt really matter to me if the price is 2 dollar or 4 dollar but thinking of the foundation there has to be a level there the iota foundation isn‚Äôt solvent anymore.  The foundation holds around 5 percent of the circulating supply. Assuming the price will drop down to 10 cents per miota would mean that the foundation has around 14 million dollars do work with.   Now assume that the foundation has to pay for 50 people that are earning around 3000 dollar per month (which is incredibly low even for a foundation) would lead to staff costs of 1.8 million dollar (without all the extra costs a employer has to pay in germany).  + hardware costs + all the travel costs for the members + rental fees for the offices + costs for external companies like lawyers + advertising + the fact they want to hire more people + they already spent a part of this 5 percent  To be honest i think the foundation would be broke if we reach a price of 10 cents.  What do i overlook? Anybody with more details about the monthly costs the foundation has? What amount of donations do they get?,At which price do we have a problem?
9191,0,"I am posting this so that some of you who may be in full-on worry mode right now with keep calm in these trying times.  I am all in on IOTA... call me stupid, but after doing endless research in the world of cryptos, the conclusion I came to is that IOTA gives any investor one of the best, if not the best, chance as far as long-term investments are concerned.  I will not dwell on all the hypothetical scenarios and potential use cases because those have been covered countless times in this subreddit and there will always be those that complain over and over when they don't get exactly what they want out of IOTA (i.e. 5,000% return on their investment). Those people are simply unrealistic... end of story.  What I will bring to everyone's attention is an often overlooked fact that gives us insight into the thought process of the IOTA Foundation. The IOTA Foundation... yes the freaking IOTA FOUNDATION... is a foundation! They are a not-for-profit organization in a crypto-universe that is filled with deceitful and many times laughable projects (if you can even call them that) that will ultimately fail and essentially go to zero as far as value is concerned. If you do not understand the advantage that the IOTA Foundation has right now just based on the fact that they are in perfect position to thrive once the regulators finally crack down on all the garbage projects in the crypto-sphere, then you do not understand what it truly takes to operate a legitimate business. Once this crackdown finally happens projects will disappear as quickly as they appeared. Simply put, IOTA wants to be a real company in a market filled with garbage and because of that they will succeed. Look at their Foundation members... it is literally the best group of brilliant, respected, and influential people involved in the crypto space... believe me I have researched it extensively. These people are not putting their reputations on the line backing some garbage project. Alright, I have ranted enough, but just want those faithful IOTA holders to keep calm and know that once the dust settles, I strongly believe IOTA will not only survive, but thrive in the ""new legitimate crypto-universe.""

9271,0,"Hi, i want to share my thoughts about future economy and what Q may be. When i did start to think about cryptocurrency, i thought it would be nice to have one currency all over the world. But with this there would be some problems. First of all, all cryptocurrencies have fixed total amount (or almost fixed), thats mean you can't take loan for your business because after few years you will not be able to give it back. And there is a problem that first in owns a lot compared to others and can throw all business or they just have more and can do more. What about people who was born only now? But in that case the crypto tokens comes in (and the ICO), thats mean you can create token for your business and sell the product only for that token.   Just imagine, you sell milk with bestMilkToken and other guy sells shoes with betterShoesToken. If you want to buy shoes, you need to sell your bestMilkToken and buy betterShoesToken. And your token is worth as much as your product is worth (or popular).Because there will be so much tokens, it's imposible to  have all pairs, thats why there will be one (or few) global cryptocurrency and we only gonna need a pair with that global coin and in the best scenario we should have decentralized exchange where we can put a new token very easy without any cost and sell ir or buy with that global coin.  And now when we have decentralized exchange, all business have their own token, all economy going to  run so smooth. It is self-regulation mechanism because no one can have big impact on global economy. For example if the banks will crash (if we still going to have them), like in 2008, then only that bank token will crash, and there will be no big impact to others, only who related to that bank or have that bank tokens. And even more, if people population will grow up, thats mean the number of business will grow up and that means the number of different tokens will grow up, if business goes down, coins of that business goes down too. It‚Äòs amazing self-regulation mechanism in business layer. And just think about investitions, you will always going to keep all your money invested, it‚Äòs amazing.  I think with this economy model we will have no crashes in economy and our money will always work, i mean they will be always invested somewhere. And maybe this is what Q is about? Colored tokens and decentralized exchange? I hope so, because that means IOTA will be that one global cryptocurrency and it will skyrocket to the mars because all sales will go through it.

9283,0,"Let's make some IOTA price prediction for coming months.   Some people believe in a bear market lasting for a few years, like it was after the spike in 2013, I don't believe so. Crypto's just starting to get mainstream and regulated. That's good. Especially for IOTA.   I think the crypto market cap will be doubled again by June. Let's say without all the releases IOTA's price will be around $4 again. But IOTA will release at least the new website, long awaited Trinity wallet, Q and IXI Hub (which means lot's of new exchanges). I think this will result in a perfect FOMO storm which will drive the price above $15. The real surge will probably start mid april when the first stuff get's released.   This is an interesting article about Q speculation: https://medium.com/@claudio_69833/iotas-ixi-module-q-the-rise-of-incredible-interoperability-maybe-339ffdf3bd12. One of the founders hinted that Q is bigger than speculated there. So draw your own conclusions, but I think the coming months will be very interesting.",IOTA price prediction coming months

9299,0,"Alright so I am not that good in English so pardon me if if it's hard to understand and its hard to type with a phone but...  Here in Finland where I am from we had currency called Markka before Euro. We devaluated our currency when our economy needed it. One day Markka could have been worth X amount and the next day it could have been worth a lot less. With IOTA you cannot really do that if your countrys economy needs it. Another way to improve economy is printing new money that central banks are doing, but that causes inflation wich is bad for a long run. As we know we have seen this before in ancient Rome, Germany and many other countries with their forgotten fiat currencies. When goverment prints money to make people do what they want for example go to war the inflation can hit hard afterwards if there is no mmm ""economical boost"" achieved withim the war.. Oil for example. Alright we know that USD is flowing in the air nowadays and printing new USD is not being controlled correctly. (Correct if I am wrong.) But once it was quite hard based in golds value. You got X amount of gold for X amount of dollars. It was supposed to be quite permament solution, but all of the sudden gold price went up and the dollar value dropped (and it's still dropping.) The goverment printed money to finance their wars (Vietnam for example. Correct me if I am wrong)   All right and now to crypto.  So... I imagine and believe that IOTA could be the next ""gold."" If Sweden chooses Iota foundation to be the one that will help them with eKrona project it could mean that they create their own currency with the Tangle, right? I personally do not believe that they would choose IOTA directly to be their currency as eKrona. Well lets imagine a little bit farer away.. If other countrys would get inspired as well and they would add their currencies in Tangle; what would be the best option to base the value to? It should be global with easy acces as gold were ""back in the days"" right? I personally think that IOTA would be that ""gold."" Currency that's useable as it is, but every goverment could basicly base their currencies value to IOTAS circulating supply. You get what I mean?   But... Could goverments make their currency ""printable"" with Tangle? That they could print and destroy their own currency in the long run as many of currencies are. (And were in the past.) And if not they could create an eCurrency with certain amount of circulation and... thats it? That would affect everything thought. Maybe less wars and the money would be split more equally, but since banks could not print more money they could maybe not be able to help countries/cities that are in crisis with their financial state.  My head is in space with these thoughts. Tell me if am I completely insane and what do you think. ",eKrona and thoughts about adoption.

I now have 2$ from my initial investment PLUS 1$ profit from the margin, giving me 3$.  Of the 2 following options  is one of them clearly smarter?  1. I close my margin position, ""cashing out"" the 1$ profit, and reopening a margin for 3$  (so I have 3$ ""capital"" and 3$ ""margin"")..6$ ""total""  2. I leave the margin position open (with the 1$ profit still inside) and up my margin position to 3$  (so I have 2$ capital and 3$ margin)... 5$ ""total""   Option 1 to me seems BOTH SAFER AND MORE PROFITABLE. - Safer because I have 3$ on margin and 3$ ""capital or collateral"" (not sure what the appropriate term is)  , giving me a margin : capital ratio of 1:1 - More profitable because I have ""6 total"" rather than 5 from option 2.  Option 2 seems riskier because I have 3$ in margin and 2$ ""capital"", making my margin/capital ratio higher (and seemingly riskier). Of course, 1$ of that margin is already in the green, but it still seems that margin/capital ratio of 3:2 is much riskier than option 1.   Am I wrong that option 1 is both more profitable and safer (or at the worst, just as safe)?  ",Confusing question about margin trading

This is litterly the first time I am posting about it to see how people would react to such a system. Currently, it is able to find arbitrage opportunities between Binance Bittrex Bitfinex HitBTC OKEx Poloniex Kraken HitBTC Huobi BitStamp GDAX and Bit-Z.  It's not like the average arbitrage bots, mine works by not only calculating the profit from buying on one exchange and selling on the other, but also considers things like trading volume to filter out poor options, so you don't waste your time on an arbitrage opportunity that only works with 10$ before the prices begin to converge. I was able to make a 4.5% profit by buying Iota on Binance and selling on Bitfinex and it didn't take me hours.  My system is designed to eliminate trading risk by keeping your money out of the market for as long as possible. The purpose is to detect when there is a large price gap between exchanges and capitalize off it, which means you get in and out as fast as possible. The only risk is the time it takes to transfer from one exchange to another, but the ERC20 tokens transfer pretty fast, so it works well with most digital currencies.  I would like to see how many people were able to successfully profit from arbitrage, also who would be interested in such a system. Especially now that Iota is so fast, it is really not as risky as other coins. Yesterday, there were opportunities for 2.5% gains.  The app is called ""CryptArbitrage"" on the Google Play Store, I'm keeping it free and adless for you guys. --------TRY IT OUT-----------------  Edit: Here is a link if you guys want https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=my.awesome.project.cryptarbitrage30 Ignore the lame id :)",I Built An Arbitrage System That Finds Arbitrage Opportunities Between Cryptocurrency Exchanges

Will IOTA be promoting the fact that it can, and should be used, as p2p transactions too? I know that IOTA is for p2p as well but I see a lot of the times that people don't think that it's p2p as well so they disregard it before actually investigating what it's about.  David S√∏nsteb√∏ - Today at 2:15 PM @MrQTree We see no limit to the project in that regard. For certain applications there needs to be some tweaking in order to fill those roles, and if other projects do those things better we will try to collaborate whereever possible.

Or something like that. **So let‚Äôs blow this boyo the fuck up, shall we.**  &amp;nbsp;  Im too lazy to find the video right now so i will provide you with a tweet where he calls IOTA a scam, good enough https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/875136798690873344  &amp;nbsp;  First of all, **we can‚Äôt get any intel on the financial situation of the IF (IOTA Foundation)**. It‚Äôs not like stocks where you can read SEC filings and shit. While they are audited and all that, no public statements have to be released concerning the foundations financial situation. So we don‚Äôt know how much money they have, how much they pay in salaries or basicly anything.  &amp;nbsp;  They have to provide an address however. So i looked it up. It's not a physical office, i think. Interestingly however, the Arne Flick Group, which consists of 4 companies from Arne Flick, shares the exact same address.  http://afg.one   *The Arne Flick Digital Consultancy offers digital product &amp; service development based on digital strategy consulting, technology implementation (e.g. based on IOTA or Relayr),  bla bla bla bla*  &amp;nbsp;  **...no venture capital would invest in IOTA my ass. Already blown the fuck up, BOYO**. That took hardly any effort, did it? Granted, we don‚Äôt know if Flick owns any IOTA tokens. But he sure does list them as ‚ÄúTechnical Partners‚Äù on here:  http://www.dogmadigital.com/team.html  While Flick seems to have a background in advertisement, he also partnered up with Robert Hanson, starting DAC. On their website it says: *Robert is legendary hacker and well-known specialist in Cybersecurity with over 22 ys of experience in hacking networks and web applications in the US as well as in international projects.*  http://dac.services/team.html  on the AFG website DAC is summarized like this:  **With our team we worked for over 2,100 banks, credit card processors, flight control systems, SCADA (water and power) control systems, and other security companies.**  *mmmmmmmmmm tasty.*   Now, again, no proof of them being invested or involved beyond platonic networking. But you would think that Robert maybe told his buddy Flick, his business partner, to stay away from IOTA, if it was as bad as some people on twitter claim. **However: Feel free to the take investment advice from some Assistant Professor from Johns Hopkins University.......**  https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/964520448678645762   and here is me browsing his twitter feed to look for that specific tweet: https://imgur.com/aZtozNA  &amp;nbsp;  Flick also has a charity goin on http://www.choicefamily.de which i think is always cool to see! Then again, could be total rip off, i don‚Äôt know and also don‚Äôt really care right now. But it shows he isn‚Äôt some struggling businessman.  &amp;nbsp;  *Sidenote: my guess is that the IF and Flick share the same admin/legal team https://www.winheller.com/en/about-us/attorneys/anka-hakert.html so they let all official documents come to that address to make it easy on them.

They are taking part in the Data Marktplace and are bigly big: https://www.accenture.com i dont know if there is a real connection there, but i thought i'd mention it. Might dig more later..  &amp;nbsp;    One thing is clear however: **IOTA is pretty good at networking.** Sure, Bosch buying into it kinda gives that away, but it‚Äôs nice to know some additional players in the background. And that will be very important once IOTA is production ready.  &amp;nbsp;   To summarize so far: **Flick is invested into IoT, Industry 4.0 and cybersecurity.** Ringing any bells? Flick is not on the IF nor does anyone from the IOTA team follow his Twitter account. But hey, this is the spec shitshow, so what did you excpect?  I‚Äôm sorry if all this already made the rounds on reddit. I‚Äôm kinda late to the IOTA party.  Another **venture captial** investor is https://outlierventures.io which, i think most are aware of. Jamie Burke wrote an article about why they invested in IOTA as early as June. https://outlierventures.io/our-first-investment-in-tokens-is-iota/  So, why did IOTA do an ICO? Why didn‚Äôt they just attract venture capital from the start skipping all that negative ICO stigma?  &amp;nbsp;  Well maybe our boys didnt have such a strong network from the get go. But:  **If you want to have a cryptocurrency, fair distribution is important. On top of that, if you only sell your tokens to a few selected investors, they have a say in your company.** Which you want to avoid, since agendas will be pushed on you.  A lot of people don‚Äôt understand that IOTA differs from ECR-20 ICO‚Äôs in the sense that the **IOTA token is part of the core protocol** and not simply a means of raising capital to work on a service. You would think people know that much. You're mistaken.   &amp;nbsp;  Another cool thing: Ralf joining the IF is great. Ralf probably has a lot of business inquiries about IOTA, so much that it makes sense for the IF to get him on board.  &amp;nbsp;  Some guy on my last Thread complained he came for investment advice but all he got was a blue collar rant. He is not wrong, you know. Anyway. I‚Äôm only doing this once: **Here is my only investment advice i'll ever give you:** Crypto is stupid. Do blow and hookers instead.  I'm also not trying to hype IOTA up, as a fairly new investor im working on my fundamentals, and im sharing these with the IOTA community. If you have a problem with that, go fuck yourself.  ..no one knows if IOTA will become a standard for IoT, but the kind of criticism and organized FUD on social media makes me think it just might become exactly that. Sure, i'm no Coder, but i read all of Eric Hops articles to smarten up: https://medium.com/@EricHop  &amp;nbsp;   **iotastronk.**  &amp;nbsp;   ps: shoutouts to /u/lamontredditthethird calling me a blue collar bitch in my last thread.  here is a comment from him:  *Yeah, see... like it's clear you haven't attended a top university. That kind of comment is clearly from some blue collar, lower class, community school, under 100K a year person... Just saying... why are YOU all the voices of IOTA HUGE RED FLAG*   &amp;nbsp;  ...  **the guy back in school who calls everyone gay generally ends up having red spots on his knees.**",spec shitshow #3

Essentially there is nothing to compare it to, and traditional valuation methods don‚Äôt work because there is no cash value in holding the asset.   If we consider another network based market place which is mature, we might get a sense of a realistic valuation for IOTA.   Take a look at Facebook, for all intent and purpose this is a glorified data market place, with a network effect. Worth 500bn. However because they only consider consumer information and nothing else, we can say IOTA should be worth at least that in a mature state, because IOTA plans to sell more than consumer behavior.  But, unlike Facebook iota holders get no cash flow from dividends. This is where the currency aspect becomes important, the cash flow is the value when in use. Imagine Facebook shareholders paying with their shares? So once iota becomes a usable currency for machine to machine payments, or someone actually pays for data with iota, which can be comparable to other data purchases historically. The valuation of IOTA should be zero, the rest is speculation.  TL:DR IOTA is worth 0 if nobody uses it, but could be worth at least 500bn at maturity. ",Some common sense valuation

9465,0,"Sorry for the mistakes, English is not my language. I trust you will understand the general idea.  When Satoshi Nakamoto launched Bitcoin there in 2009 and without knowing it, the basis of madness was established; hundreds of cryptographic currencies and their projects. A large pile of items almost abruptly packed where you have to stop to discriminate what is really worthwhile garbage, not because there is much that is worthwhile but because the ruma has become so big that it makes us work more. However, a quick glance with a critical eye and without passion still manages to let us perceive that most of what we see is waste that some people buy as if it were gold. Few could have imagined how far it would take the initiative of the named creator of the ""mother cryptography"". We have witnessed the birth of this great Babylon with a large Bitcoin B; Not because Bitcoin in itself is a kind of panacea. If not because at least it was the lighter of a technology that promises. And I'm not talking about the blockchain, but also about the DAG-based cryptography. (Directed Acrylic Graphics) The promise of a world that is reinvented once again by the hand of technology is almost overwhelming. To be fair, this madness has its reasons. Undoubtedly, economic profit is the great promotion of all opportunistic and even blatantly grotesque initiatives. And this is true. But do I disagree with the competition in the new technology and the new market? Not in any way. What is detestable is opportunism and greed; Have not you heard about the ICO phenomenon? From project leaders who become grossly rich overnight by assigning themselves a large stake in the supply of their currencies ... Madness ... disorder ... shamelessness? All the madness of which I speak seems necessary so that all this gibberish comes a polished technology and a free market of so much filth. Babylon, Babel (in Hebrew) or Babylon (in Greek) was the jewel of the ancient world, with its great tower that pretended to reach the clouds. And we are the actors of this new version of the same story that is repeated again and again in what seems to be a necessary route to [order]. Yes, ORDER Yes, you have heard about ""Ordo ab chao"" (chaos of order). Well, it is said that the Jesuits are masters of this doctrine, which they practically institutionalized as an intrinsic part in their methods to carry out their ends. But calm, it is not my intention to talk about conspiracy theories, or to imply that the Jesuits have anything to do with the confusion in the cryptographic world; just stay with that doctrine as a real basis for what will happen in cryptography in some time. There will be order, do not hesitate, there will be regulation. Untraceable anonymous transactions ... I do not think so. The unusable rubbish will be removed and some things that have benefit will be recycled. But above all, the great jewels like IOTA and some more, will be on top of everything. These are my reflections. Feel free to comment ...","What will remain of the Babylon, with B of Bitcoin.(the birth of something better)"

Fun thing about the crypto space is, that people post so much shit on social media it let‚Äôs you paint any narrative you want. If you would be so kind, let me tell you about mine:  **I could care less about wealthy people flapping their dicks in public, talking about legal issues.** What I do care about however, is when for-profit companies systematically bully a non-profit company, with the help of media outlets that have, not only private, but also a conflict of interest. Now why is that, after all i could chase the next scam ICO pump n‚Äô dump on Binance and why rip open old wounds anyway, can‚Äôt we just move on? Please?  *clears throat*  &amp;nbsp;    **The IOTA Foundation is by german law bound to exclusively and solely pursue the public interest, to promote science and research and to act with selfless interest.** *(or something along those lines).*  This is the biggest *fuck off* you can signal to your ""competitors"". *It‚Äôs almost like David doesn‚Äôt mind telling people to fuck off*. Besides Charlie Lee, who has absolutely no fucking clue what he is talking about when it comes to IOTA, that **signal has been recieved.**  &amp;nbsp;  https://youtu.be/wY2DXoQ4STw?t=1h8m19s go back to sleep, Charlie. You big cutie.  &amp;nbsp;   The IF needs to generate some money inflow.. get involved with the economy and all that good stuff. Thanks to being non-profit, chances are **that money won‚Äôt end up in the cayman islands.** Fingers crossed. They also get a huge taxcut in the process - because the Foundations goals are in the interest of the broader public. Having the opportunity to invest in something like IOTA is actually kinda neat if you think about it.  I made this point in my last thread but i really want to stress this one: **If you are a for-profit company in the crypto space and think you have any kind of moral high ground over a non-profit organisation, fuck off. It‚Äôs an insult to the broader public and makes you look like a douchebag.**   Oh wait.. Oh no.. this is about cryptography and research, right? I can't possibly comment on the critics who.. WRONG. Thankfully, i don't need to be a worldclass soccer player either to understand that the FIFA is a corrupt piece of shit, do i. Thing is, i never claim to have any kind of authority in the first place.  &amp;nbsp;  I could go on and badly quote out of the http://iota.org/satzung.pdf but.. meh. DYOR.  Dominik and David *so far* have been doing all the right moves to deliver on their vision, if you like that or not. Without going the extra mile and legal hassle of opening the IF, none of you should be nearly as excited about IOTA as you are. In a sea of scams and shady practices, **IOTA has so far established itself as a legitimate breeding ground for new technology and innovation. Until proven otherwise. Delays in technological advancements of the protocol and academic nitpicking does not and will not change that fact.**   &amp;nbsp;  As another result of the IF being non-profit, companies engaging themselves with the IF don't instantly look suspicious (even if they have done wrong in the past). Or at least it‚Äôs an effort they are making. Compared to all those shady banks and websites partnering up with Ripple. No, i‚Äôm serious. Check this out.. almost puked into my mouth a little:   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E1AcLBd_ykemoDAPwZsbl5f2wyrS7RhlAt94CrHXTAg/edit#gid=1168577263  Corporations like VW understand that in a future, **two cars from different brands need to communicate with each other on a neutral and secure protocol.**  What would be the incentive for two car manufactureres be to bring in a middle man (a for profit company) when the whole fucking point of this excercise is to **cut out the middle man?!**..  And since this is a speculative shitshow: maybe even some Central Banks realize a more optimized, decentralized and fair (machine)economy could get rid of all that debt our Parents have dumped on us. Just a wild thought. Just dreaming. Maybe this whole decentralized disruptive revolution which, 10 years after Satoshis whitepaper, has blessed our society with the likes of ""Cryptographic Kittens"", turns out to be a more... natural progression. Less vindictive than anticipated by the Bitcoin community.. Maybe, just maybe, the State won‚Äôt put a gun to your head and make you forfeit your crypto bags.  And you know, **maybe the correct legal framework for that innovation is a regulated non-profit organisation in a sovereign state with a strong economic backbone.**   &amp;nbsp;   Ooof, now if that isn‚Äôt cazy speculative, what is?!

The first time i heard about it is in the FinancialMagnets podcast, here Dom talks about the problem of volatility: business dont want their IoT devices earning a currency that might loose 10% of its value in a day. The solution he proposed is to work with banks to create a way to transform Fiat into IOTA and back instantly, now an IoT device has 2 wallets one for Fiat and one for IOTA, when it needs to make a payment he just swaps Fiat to IOTA sends IOTA and the receiver swaps ( all or a part) back to its Fiat wallet. Dave also talked about it in the IvanOnTech interview, here he also said that Dom was working on something like this before he joined IOTA.  Now to why such a thing is BIG for IOTA, first of all it solves the problem that business have with volatility. Also it allows for super fast and super cheap payments for everyone( like what ripple wants to do but much better) allowing IOTA to be used in retail without fearvof losing income due to price volatility. Also it becomes a Fiat/Crypto Gateway as now everyone can transform Fiat into IOTA and sell it on exchanges for other crypro, and same to cash out, IOTA would become new standard exchange pair. Also it brings massive volume to IOTA as everyone is constantly selling and buying ( not a finance expert) this should make the market more resilient to whale's. Also all this transactions make the Tangle stronger, faster and more secure. Probably there are other things for witch this can be used, for example if Nations have their currency on Tangle ( like sweden might do) you could swap on currency into IOTA and than into another currency making IOTA an exchange pair even for Fiat.

9501,0,,Anyone recently invest IOTA? What makes it great?
9505,0,Thoughts on the recent statement by the SEC that all cryptos that meet a certain criteria must register with the SEC? I'm not a lawyer and dont know how significant this will be for the IOTA Foundation.   Edit: [Source](https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/929408/Bitcoin-price-Ripple-news-latest-cryptocurrency-market-price-SEC-CFTC) ,How significant will the recent request by the SEC be for IOTA/IOTA Foundation?
9506,0,"hi,  &amp;nbsp;  im here to have some fun. english is not my first language so bear with me.  now, before we fall down the rabbit hole of wild speculations, lets level first.  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  **crypto is part of a paradigm shift in how we interact with data. money is just a form of data. ripple wont be that shift.**  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  take that, ripple!  of course, XRP might save you some money while you are transfering 10k with moneygram to a nigerian prince, but else it doesnt get more boring considering we are in a paradigm shift. or ncash - the usecase is simply to narrow minded considering where society is headed. anyway.  i take it as a given that you guys read the leaked emails, if not heres a fun recap: https://medium.com/iota-demystified/iota-vs-dci-or-how-an-innocent-hash-collision-became-a-huge-ego-collision-425114e61e8f  and this: https://pastebin.com/nGsmFFXP   &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  im posting these because i want to make a point that i hope sticks with everyone here because i think the DCI incident is just a taste of whats to come - and i loved every second of it. **because you are not part of a paradigm shift if you dont rustle some academic jimmies**. see that crazy guy over there saying the world isnt flat? thats right. we want that. we want our network under attack 24/7 and hundreds of coders going trough every single line of code there is. if not - IOTA wouldnt be relevant.   &amp;nbsp;  so yesterday a document was released by the   &amp;nbsp;  **COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS**  *FinTech Action plan: For a more competitive and innovative European financial sector*  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/180308-action-plan-fintech_en.pdf   i dont know about you but that sounds like something you might want to give a read if you are invested into crypto, but maybe thats just me.  &amp;nbsp;   &gt;FinTech solutions using digital identification, mobile applications, cloud computing, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, blockchain and distributed ledger technologies are being rolled out.  &amp;nbsp; *bla bla bla bla* &amp;nbsp;  &gt;It can help to deepen and broaden EU capital markets by integrating digitisation to change business models through data-driven solutions for example in asset management, investment intermediation and product distribution  &amp;nbsp; *bla bla bla bla* &amp;nbsp; &gt;Blockchain and distributed ledger technologies will likely **lead to a major breakthrough that will transform the way information or assets are exchanged, validated, shared and accessed through digital networks.**   &amp;nbsp;  you have my attetion. thats one hell of a stance. couple years ago people laughed at crypto. lets see if there are connections to IOTA:  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which will become applicable in May 2018, is also of critical importance for a proper use of innovative datadriven financial services15 as is the proposal for a Regulation on a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the EU16, which seeks to ensure that non-personal data can move freely across the single market.  &amp;nbsp;  there we go. our first lead. the foundation is very aware of this landscape. good sign. even better: they educate us on the topic!  https://blog.iota.org/privacy-is-not-a-currency-63018fc45920  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;FinTech is a priority area also at the international level, for example for the G20.  (and way later in the document)  &gt;**Some technology providers already make efforts to inform regulators and supervisors about the nature of their technologies and how they are applied in the financial sector**. However, many authorities are reluctant to receive training or engage in discussions when hosted by selected vendors.   &gt;The Commission will **establish an EU FinTech Lab to raise the level of regulatory and supervisory capacity and knowledge about new technologies**. It will do this through demonstrations and expert discussion in a non-commercial, neutral financial technology Laboratory. The Lab will bring together multiple vendors, in particular from the EU, with regulators and supervisors so they can raise and discuss regulatory and supervisory concerns.  &gt;The technologies addressed could include:  &gt;-authentication and identification technologies,  &gt;-application programming interfaces and open banking standards and   &gt;-specific cases for using distributed ledger technology, cloud technology, machine learning and artificial intelligence,   &gt;-RegTech  &amp;nbsp;  granted, i have no idea what regtech is but one thing i do understand. one addition to the foundation makes a lot more sense now: https://blog.iota.org/welcome-julie-maupin-to-iota-14b9ac92478f  let me quote: **Julie currently sits on the Fintech advisory board of the German Ministry of Finance and the G20 Digital Economy Experts Task Force and is a resource person for the UN Internet Governance Forum**  so you see, things start to make sense. without a person like julie on your **non profit** foundation, there would be little to no sense to even try to do what IOTA tries to do. now we start to understand why the foundation set their priorities the way they did and understand how **genious** this approach is. **maybe IOTA has a chair on this table**. ye ye trinity, Q... whatever lets move on:  they even got some extra intel on their team: https://blog.iota.org/welcome-mark-sulavka-to-the-iota-foundation-f4d7172e5aa9  thats some OG fintech right there. just listen to what he says:  **we see incredible opportunities to change the viability, costs basis and execution of dozens of industries and verticals.**  now heres a big question: ...will the IF be part of the EU FinTech Lab?  In the document they also talk a lot about the threat of cyber security. Of course, if you start to connect every device into a network and so on, having that network disrupted would be more than fatal. **in my opinion cyber terrorism is probably the biggest threat right now besides nuclear weapons**. without electricity or the web our society simply will not function anymore and people will die, make no mistake about it.  &amp;nbsp;  &gt;As the financial sector becomes increasingly dependent on digital technology, ensuring that the financial sector is safe and resilient is essential. In this respect, the Commission aknowledges the importance for digital services to incorporate a 'security by design approach' and, in this respect, has already put forward a proposal36 to create an EU certification framework for ICT security products and services.  &amp;nbsp; ok this one im pulling out of my ass BUT we know that israel is at the forefront of cyber security. because with these kinda neighbours you really have to be. wouldnt it be awesome if IOTA would have people working in the same city as probably the leading experts in cyber security are? considering data integrity is a major feature in the protocol?  https://blog.iota.org/iota-tel-aviv-office-is-official-5715aec23a1e  you see where i am going with this. iota tries to solve REAL WORLD PROBLEMS. our society NEEDS something like IOTA to continue to go on this path we are on. will it be IOTA? as small retail investors - one can only hope.  now here comes what still boggles my mind. IOTA goes even one step further - fully understanding what we just learned. **they want to build a network that solves all of the above, make industry 4.0 happen, pushes data out of centers into the fog and make it OPEN FOR EVERYONE**. jesus fucking christ. its almost to good to be true.  now when they say they dont have liberal intetions, like david likes to pride himself with - they are right. this has nothing to do with political affiliations or agendas **either your tech cuts it or it does not**. and if you are a for profit company - you can fuck right off because you already lost all legitamacy IMHO.  https://youtu.be/K1XMobDJpS0?t=57m15s (timestamped)  i think there is more to IOTA than bosch and IOT, trinity, JINN and Q. and if we only focus on these things we miss the bigger picture of what IOTA is trying to achieve. and if this goes bust, thats okey i only **invest what i can afford to loose**. and maybe you guys can stop being impatient fucks crying for announcments and together we can dig into this more deeply and learn how society will change and how IOTA will be part of that change :)  if i completly missunderstood some parts i quoted, let me know.  #iotastronk  peeaaace out  edit: timestamp was wrong         ",spec shitshow #1
9507,0,"Hello people. Remember when iota launched? $1. That is what its fundamental valuation was. Then, after the fud about their curl function it dropped to 40 cents per iota. Of course, it went to $5 dollars after that and paid off my student loans but I don't see iota dropping as a bad thing.  Remember when bitcoin crashed from $30 to $2? Remember when bitcoin crashed from $10 o $1? Remember when bitcoin crashed from $1000 to $200? Remember when iota crashed from $1 to $.4? Remember when iota crashed from $5 to $1? Oh man.. those were the days that you could get iota cheap.   And I bet you that when btc crashed there were panic sellers, not dip buyers, and very few dip chewers. Buy the dip. Revel in it. Soak in those good lovable low prices. Because in five years from now when 1 btc is worth 500k and 1 iota is worth $125, you will be happy you bought the dip.   /rant over.",Buy the dip.

9510,0,"I think it is time for some positivity and a nice overview of what's coming up.    Upcoming (confirmed):  * Trinity wallet: finally a mega user-friendly wallet with automatic reattach/promote. Will give IOTA a great boost for the average crypto user. Beta release mobile, expected begin April 2018. Desktop version soon after mobile. Some sneak peeks: https://blog.iota.org/iota-trinity-wallet-next-steps-12922a53f8d2.  * IXI Hub: IOTA plug and play for exchanges (including Forex?). ""IOTA will be added to all major exchanges"". Coming soon.  * Q...... or should we say Qubic? rumours say its about distributed computing (https://medium.com/@724554/iotas-q-qubic-c361f86bde7d) but it might be well something else. Anyway founders says that it will be one of the biggest things to occur to the IOTA project so far. Expected Q1 2018.   * New website, expected Q1 2018.  * Major network improvements, with the goal to first decentralize, and then remove COO by Q4 2018/Q1 2019. Also they want to use this year to make IOTA production ready (out of b√®ta state).  * Setup and expansion of IOTA foundation in 2018. They want to hire a lot of new skilled people this year.  * Data marketplace launch with a lot of participants (you can check the actual list at data.iota.org).    Ongoing projects and news related to IOTA:  * Oyster Protocol (https://oysterprotocol.com ): ""Great new project about the future of website monetization and distributed storage, built on IOTA Tangle and Ethereum. Mainnet april 2018.""  * Cogniota (http://www.cogniota.io ): Machine learning as a service. ""The goal is indeed to get mining pools to switch over to providing a useful service (Machine Learning) while paid in iotas. A lot of miningfarms are struggling these days, so this is a very win-win situation. Goal being that you, as an individual, can make iotas on your GPU that is idle when you're not playing/rendering some shit yourself. In Asia there are still a fuckton of gaming cafes as well which could earn money outsourcing their GPUs during the hours that there's less gamers"".  * PEAQ (https://www.peaq.io ): ""tokenization of everything, from cars, jewelry to photographs and music will be tradable instantly and without fees on the IOTA Tangle"".  * Major support by Bosch and Volkswagen! Use cases will follow soon. E.g. autonomous vehicles.  * Smart city projects, e.g. Taipei, with TangleID.  * CFB's 'side' projects like JINN (ternary processors), ICT (Iota Controlled agenT) and god knows where he's working on.  * All great initiatives by Roman Semko to support IOTA: CarrIOTA, Nelson, Field, Bolero.  * Smart contracts are in development as a layer on top of IOTA (https://medium.com/@ralf/about-smart-contracts-in-iota-626d2bd3619e).  * IOTA's still a candidate for the e-Crown project.  * IOTA ecosystem fund (https://blog.iota.org/announcing-the-iota-ecosystem-339612656bc3) and all projects that will make use of this.  * Tokyo Metropolitan Government accelerator program participant (https://blog.iota.org/iota-selected-by-tokyo-metropolitan-government-program-fde6b34ddc16) thanks sphynx88.  * EV charging project ElaadNL (https://www.elaad.nl/news/iota-charging-station-new-video-online/) thanks sphynx88  * ...... (i'm probably missing x projects here)    FUD:  * All major FUD attacks from recent months have been knocked down and proven wrong so far. All based on misinterpretations or a lack of knowledge of IOTA's tech.    As you see, there's so incredibly much going on. Don't focus too much on all mentioned 'deadlines', these are just indications given by the team. Look at the big picture of where IOTA's heading to, the backbone of IoT, with a focus on M2M payments. I think current price ($1.3 at the moment of writing) is a real steal.    Finally I would like to leave this IOTA TA here. I know it's often bullshit, and the price is related to many factors, but it's certainly possible: https://www.tradingview.com/chart/IOTUSD/FKqT7oYA-IOTA-idea-based-on-trendlines/.

And therefore - Yes : Good news have to be announced,  regardless the current terrible market sentiment !

9671,0,"I know alot of people on here seriously do actually believe that one day a crypto-currency such as IOTA could somehow replace a fiat currency to become the domestic currency for a 1st world country such as USA/UK/Europeans... ect  I personally think that the notion of that is totally and utterly delusional, and physically impossible for multiple reasons- However i could theoretically be wrong! :)  So instead of me just point-blank saying that it's impossible, Im instead asking people to kindly please explain how specifically it could actually be possible (taking into account all the multiple key obstacles)??  ~  **The issues which cause me to think that its totally and utterly impossible, and so thinking it to be possible is purely delusional, all centre around one thing** - Debt!  The entire world economy is built upon debt, revolves around debt, only functions and operates due to debt, and would quite simply completely collapse without debt.  It may not be good, may not be economically-healthy, morally-right, or technically efficient, However that is how the entire world economy is built and structured, and the only way it can now continue to function without total economic collapse and humanitarian chaos ensuing, by revolving around countless layers of debt.   **To explain what i mean by debt, how it works, and how crypto-currencies which are just invented out of thin air by private companies could not replace the fiat in that debt-ecosystem, I will use the USA as the example-**  The USA government recieves (X) amount of money per each year in the form of taxes and revenue from other sources,  but they have to spend (Y) amount of money each year on paying for hospitals staff salaries, schools staff salaries, police staff salaries, road maintenance, unemployment benefits, pensions, and dozens of other core basic expenses to keep society operating.  The amount of money which the USA government recieves each year (X) is far less than the amount of money which they need to spend each year to pay for all the costs of operating society (Y).  *(This is not my personal opinion, it is solid fact, and has been the same way for 50+years.  Its what's called a budget-defecit)*   **For the purpose of this example lets say that (X) is 33% lower than (Y), so they recieve ¬£70 in taxes but need to payout ¬£100 in costs.**  So the USA government now has 2 choices at the end of each year-  1) Refuse to pay salaries to teachers, doctors, nurses, police officers, the army, which will cause the entire USA to turn into a meltdown of chaos, looting, violence and dis-order across the entire country.  or   2) Borrow money from other countries/companies/people to fill that ¬£30 gap in their expenses, or in other words go into ¬£30+ worth of debt.  -  The way that the USA government borrows that money is by issuing IOUs (called government bonds) which are simply just pieces of paper that say ''If you lend me ¬£5 today, in 4years i will repay you the holder of this piece of paper ¬£6''.  So the USA government holds auction where it tries to sell as many of these IOUs as possible to other countries/companies/individual people for as much money as possible.  Unfortunately though they are only able to make ¬£10 by doing this, so still need to find an extra ¬£20 from somewhere to pay all those doctors and firefighter's salaries.  So they then turn to the Federal Reserve, which is basically just a government organisation/building that has a printing-press inside of it which is capable of printing out an unlimited amount of dollars, and tell the Federal reserve that they need to BORROW ¬£20 from them.  The way that transaction works is that the Fed give the USA government ¬£20 cash, and in return they get given an IOU by the government saying ''We will repay you ¬£22 in 5years from now''.  Those IOUs which the Fed, other countries, companies, and people now own are themselves then bought and sold to other people/companies/countries.  That is 1year.  Year 2 comes and goes, end of year 2 the USA government needs to do the exact same thing again, so they issue more IOUs, and the Federal Reserve print out another ¬£20 extra cash and lend it to them.   Year 3, Year 4, Year 5 all come and go in the exacy same way.  But so now after 5years the USA government is in debt of ¬£50 to IOU-holders, plus in debt of ¬£100 to the Federal reserve, plus ontop of that they have to pay out an extra ¬£10 this year to all IOU-holders in the form of interest payments.  So end of year 5 the USA government now need to raise ¬£40 to cover the shortfall. They can still only raise ¬£10 from other countries/people, and so have to now borrow ¬£30 from the Federal Reserve.  Fortunately the Fed has that magic printing-press inside their building to be able to create that new ¬£30 out of thin air and loan it to the USA government, as without that, well doctos and firefighter and army would not get paid, children would starve to death as their parents would have no money to buy them food... ect  Fast-forward 60years, and that same cycle has been going on for the last 60years, so the USA government is now in debt of many hundreds of pounds (or in other terms (X) is still only ¬£70 per year, but they owe ¬£700).  That ¬£700 is owed to dozens of other big powerful countries, companies, and foreign people, all of whom want to be paid back the money which they invested, and so NONE of them would be fine with the USA just turning around and saying them ''Look we don't like this current money system anymore as we are losing from it, so can we just forget all of the money we owe you in debt please and instead start a new kinda system?''.  ~  The ONLY reason why society has not collapsed into total anarchy and chaos, why there isn't mass-scale looting and riots all over the USA, why cities aren't all on fire but with no firefighters to put them out, is because the USA government have the security of knowing that that printing press sitting inside the Federal Reserve building is there, is always available to them, and will never say no to them (as they own it).  ~  But so if all those firefighters, doctors, school-teachers, and army now suddenly decided that they wanted to be paid their salary in IOTAs (or any other crypto-currency),  the USA government would quite simply just say to them that thats physically impossible since they do not have an IOTAs printing machine, only have a DOLLARS printing machine.  For them to be able to replace the DOLLAR with IOTAs as the domestic and national currency there would need to be an IOTA central-hub, who had a machine from which they could print unlimited more IOTAs whenever needed, and who was willing to do that and then lend them all to the USA government whenever requested in exchange for IOUs.  Without that the government would not be able to function, so society would meltdown, millions of people would die in violence and riots, children would starve to death, war would come by invasions from other countries who took over the USA land-mass and enslaved the population (as there would be no army anymore)... ect  All the countries/companies/people who were holding those IOUs which the USA government had previously sold them would panic about how the debt owed to them via that IOU would be converted into IOTAs, and how those IOTAs would then convert into their own countries domestic currency exchange rate vs what the value of the dollar was when they bought the IOU.  You make China and Russia angry by refusing to pay them the debt you owe them, they will just send in their huge armies to invade USA and seize assets worth the outstanding debt.  **~**  If multiple countries somehow did manage to all magically adopt IOTA as their domestic currency (like the EURO) you would then simply have all the problems that you had with the EURO in that:  -How can a German-IOTA be worth the same as a Polish-IOTA or a Greek-IOTA when the German economy is so much richer and more prosperous?   -If a country needed to borrow more IOTAs, but the European Central Bank didn't exist, where would the country borrow their IOTAs from?   -What if someone hacked into Germany's IOTA-wallet and stole all of the countries money?   -How would IOTA or any digital currency work for people don't have access to internet, or in areas of countries where you cant get internet such as mountains/forests?  -Who would be the governing body that decided to change where the decimal point in IOTA goes (to effectively divide the number of available IOTAs into a far greater quantity without affecting the wealth value of current holders)?  -How would the current outsanding IOTAs already in circulation all be repatriated back to a central-distributer, and who would that distributer be?  -Would that repatriation not happen, and so effectively the few thousand current IOTA holders would all become multi-billionaires overnight, and hold all the currency in circulation in Europe?  **~**  As I said I may potentially be wrong with what i've said about that itd be physically impossible for IOTA (or any crypto) to ever replace a fiat currency to become the domestic currency for any stable western country...  **But so if there are still people who do believe it to be possible, kindly please explain how specifically it can actually be possible (taking into account all the multiple key obstacles)??**  ",How exactly could IOTA (or any crypto) ever possibly replace a fiat currency to become the domestic currency for any stable western country?!?

9693,0,"This is from a post in r/nanocurrency, as a hodler of Iota i would like some feedback as i keep seeing how Nano is superior to IOTA. Please help   In this post, I will be comparing the two most popular DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) cryptocurrencies on the market, Nano and IOTA, by measuring each on several key metrics.  Micropayments Both IOTA and Nano have 0 transaction fees so they are tied in that respect. However, in addition to feeless, a micropayment should also be fast. A transaction in IOTA won't necessarily go through the first time, and may require a client to ""re-attach"" and ""re-broadcast"" an indeterminate number of times. After it is submitted, an IOTA transaction takes several minutes to confirm (although the developers claim it will be faster in the future as the network grows). Nano today takes around 5-10 seconds for the transaction to propagate through the network. Also, addresses in IOTA are not meant to be persistent -- once an address is used to send a transaction, it cannot be used to receive any more funds.  Winner: Nano Decentralization IOTA uses coordinators to prevent double spends and ensure nodes are participating on a non-malicious chain. The developers say the coordinators will be removed when the transaction volume has reached a sufficient threshold. However, the required threshold of tps growth has not been stated, and to ensure security, the coordinators would need to be in place as long as there is ever a possible time when tps dips below that level. Nano uses representatives to prevent double spends, and any node can function as a representative. Currently, the official representatives, controlled by the developers, account for around 55% of the voting stake, so Nano is also centralized in that respect. However, there is nothing in the protocol that prevents wallets from choosing different representatives today, and the developers have stated they will make an effort to encourage users to set non-official representatives.  Winner: Nano Scalability Nano claims it has can achieve 7000tps, which is a number from the developers that came from a testnet. We have also seen periods of 300tps with no network degradation. However, there is no inherent limit on the tps in the protocol, and instead is limited by the hardware used by the nodes. IOTA claims it has ""unlimited scalability"" but the exact same hardware bottlenecks exist due to it being a public distributed ledger -- namely disk space, network bandwidth, and disk I/O. Also, there have been periods in the recent past where IOTA has been spam attacked, and valid transactions were not confirming for hours. Additionally, IOTA transaction sizes are much larger than Nano's, so fewer transactions can occur with the same amount of resources.  Winner: Nano M2M IOTA claims that IOTA is not for peer to peer transactions and is instead targeting machine to machine transactions used in the Internet of Things. I believe that this is largely misdirection, and there is no inherent difference between a p2p transaction and an m2m transaction. Both occur from a node running on a computer to another node running on another computer. IOTA claims it can be used as a data marketplace to buy and sell data by attaching data onto IOTA transactions. While Nano does not support this, the design IOTA uses is not only unnecessary, but actually a bad way of transferring data. IOTA uses the gossip protocol for messaging, where any data transmission will be broadcasted to every node in the network, which for significant amounts of data could quickly overwhelm the network. IOTA nodes are already configured to ignore data they are not interested in, so it makes little sense to incur this extra bandwidth overhead. A much better way would be direct connections using IP addresses/static urls for the data transfer, and then a data marketplace could just as easily be built using Nano for the payment exchange.  Winner: Nano",Concerns from a Hodler

Moreover the CEOs (founders) are getting the exact same public-money capital injection into their company to enable them to fund, operate, and run their business,  but yet do not have the risk of being removed from their role if they fail to deliver satisfactory returns for investors,  and do not have to be accountable to us the people who are funding them and paying their operating costs and bills for them.

9740,0,"I've just been looking at [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbJMtJq20NY) which is a really interesting background on the development of the ternary chip being presented by (what it appears to be) one of the JINN project team members.  As interesting as this all seems, I am wondering what the true impact of this development will be with regard to IOTA.    Technically speaking, I can see the advantages of having a ternary chip that is actually utilized by a distributed ledger in the context of embedded devices (etc), but is this really the ""clincher"" that makes IOTA better than other cryptos?  Does it really add something extraordinary that other cryptos cannot do?  I can see it being the driver for usage in various machine technologies, but are holders of IOTA really going to benefit from any of this in terms of price in the short-term?  A ternary chip - as exciting as it is - might cause the market to get pumped for a short moment, but I'm thinking that the price will go back to where it was once the news sinks in because there still is no immediate reason to continue to hold IOTA until we see actual devices being rolled out - perhaps 2-3 years from now?",Impact &amp; meaning of JINN/Ternary on IOTA
9742,0,"Hi guys, Let us say that you have a smart storage facility that contains items of value, measured normally in dollars. You buy the item from a store, and place it in the facility. The store has a chip placed in the item that interacts with your facility, and every time you deplete part of the item, that depletion is recorded to the iota tangle. Because iota price is divorced from the dollar valuation due to markets, iota could lose its ability to become a unit of account.  Lets take an example: You assign the value of a bottle of milk to be 2 Miota at the store. You buy it with 2 Miota, and take it home to your fridge. Every time you pour a glass of milk, the fridge weighs its contents when the door was opened, notes the item that was withdrawn and is no longer signalling and then weighs the change in weight when the item is returned. Yay! now we have a smart fridge that knows you drank exactly .32215 Miota worth of milk.   But wait! The price of Miota goes up on the exchange! Why? Because Joe Blow the billionaire decided to convert his second house valued at 65 million dollars.... into iota. Now, iota is worth 3$ rather than $2. Now, we have a problem. Your smart fridge reports back to the store via the datamarket that you have drunk .32215 iota worth of milk. The store looks at its inventory and converts that to dollars. But wait... that value when you bought the milk was $.6. Now, its $.96! Suddenly, iota is no longer a proper unit of account in relation to the dollar cost of a carton of milk.  The only way to solve this problem is to have arbitrary hard defined values for what an object is worth in iota. I assume that is something a company will do, but those companies MUST come to a consensus. In this manner 1 iota could equal 1 lambo, or 1000 iota could equal a glass of milk. Do you begin to see the trade off?   Iota as a currency cannot be used as a unit of account for anything except for the value of the raw sensor data. It cannot be used to price a physical good, unless the entire economic system is converted to iota. If parts of the system run in dollars or euros, then swings in price will throw off the economic data.  What iota needs is a secondary token running on top of the iota protocol. This secondary token is used for nothing except to measure the physical quantities of a good. For example, 1 jug of milk is 1000 of this new token, and 1 car is one of this new token, because a jug of milk can be partially consumed, while a car either runs or does not run. In this manner, physical quantities can be tracked via the the supply of this new token. Creators of goods can create the token, assign it to a good, and as the good is sent along to the consumer, each member of the chain can be credited or debited the units of that good. But it needs to run as part of the iota protocol, and it needs to be tied to iota in some manner.",Pricing in iota

9745,0,"So, iota lacks smart contracts. Why?   1. No concurrency.  2. No timeclock.  What do we need to enforce smart contracts?  1. We need a way to store a smart contract on the tangle in a manner that every node can view the contract, and run it if necessary.   2. We need a method to tell time. In blockchain, its blockheight. Iota is the tangle, and although a tangle based solution, such as the depth of the contract in the network might be able to work, other solutions such as soliciting a UTC timestamp from every iota node for every transaction might allow smart contracts to average 100 randomly picked timestamps out of the last 1000 transactions to get an accurate timestamp down to under a minute.   Why do we need smart contracts?  1 we need to compete against ethereum.  2. we need to be able to atomic swap.  3. We need to decentralize the data market. This could be done with smart contracts. Running on iota, not ethereum. ",Iota lack of smart contracts

9747,0,"UPDATE: Given how off-topic this thread has become I will be abandoning this thread, and instead create a new topic with a more succinctly worded title and intro- --------------------------------------------------  Token holders cannot remove/sack the CEOs (Founders), have no influence at all on the decisions of this company, can't decide by themselves if the dividends have to be paid, and can't organise a vote for any important decision.   These tokens look like a seriously weaker version of shares, since as token holders we have no real power nor influence, but yet we are taking the exact same monetary risk as traditional shareholders.  Moreover the CEOs (founders) are getting the exact same public-money capital injection into their company to enable them to fund and run their business, but yet do not have the risk of being removed from their role if they fail to deliver, and do not have to be accountable to us the people who are funding them and paying their operating costs and bills for them.   But so how is this new innovative system better than the ""old"" one?  As we have bought a part of the capital of this company without having any control on the company itself, getting no equity in the company, no ownership stake, no voting rights, and no guarantee whatsoever that the value of the tokens will even increase in value based on how successful the company may be.  But so in your view WHY should coin-holder investors who take the same risk as share-holder investors not also be entitled to the same rights as share-holder investors  ~  Edit:  Oh and people can downvote or flame me as much as they want, I don't care as it has no actual effect on me, But instead of simply doing that because ''you've read something which you don't like about something which you (like-me) have invested your own hard-earned cash into'', Why not instead take the more logical and mature approach of actually truly considering what I have said, and the highly important valid points and concerns which I have raised?  As whilst I know the entire Cryptocurrency-sphere seems to boast and market itself on the line that it's ''anti-capitalist'', and is innovation designed to help out the 'everyday little-man' in the street rather than the 'fat-cat financiers' by restoring power and control to the ordinary everyday person; The model of investors being merely token-holders rather than share-holders does the total complete opposite,  As it simply takes away ALL the rights, influence and power of investors, and instead gives them to the central-management CEOs (founders).","Are Coin-holder investors merely people who take the exact same monetary risk as Share-holder investors, But without getting any of the benefits/perks/security/or power that Shareholders get??"

My biggest problem with crypto atm is that I just can't see cryptos being used as a currency as long as the price is based on speculation and bounces around like crazy.  I mean everybody is hating on fiat currency, while almost nobody knows the definition for fiat currency. Cryptos and therefore iota are fiat based currency with a unstable price.  And remember! This is just a question and no fud. really hate the fact that it is impossible to talk critical with people regarding crypto.

9851,0,"Hi all,  I just wanted to give a little heads up that the latest dev update from Cobx mentions that Iota will be listed soon. See link here: https://medium.com/cobinhood/dev-update-7-bigger-things-ahead-9f67aee59  Please only read further if you would haven't been following cobx developmpents and would to hear one man's opinion. (Full disclosure, I do hold a bit of COB).   Anyway, I think some people have been down on this exchange because admittedly they over-promised for the release, and then under-delivered. It was not a smooth roll-out. The period when withdraws were executed manually was not fun, and the low limits were an issue for many. Furthermore, the exchange ran into regulatory issues and has had to backtrack on its plans to offer real USD. This is unfortunate, but somewhat outside of Cobinhood's control. In any event, USDT will be starting soon, with Iota to follow soon after that. Other positive developments of late are that automatic withdraws have been activated and work seamlessly -- and limits have been increased significantly.  Please allow me to just also say why I think Cobx will be great for Iota. We are now listed on a few different exchanges, but the only two major ones for most people are Bitfinex and Binance. Both great exchanges -- but Bitfinex remains inaccessible to US based people, and Binance lacks a USD pair. While we do not yet have official confirmation from Cobx of a USDT/Iota pairing, myself and others have been in touch with admins and have been urging them to make sure Iota gets a USDT pairing. This will be good for Iota because it will become the only major exchange catering to US customers with a fiat pair for iota. In June, when margin is introduced, it will be the only place for US customers to margin on that pair (unless other exchanges offer this first, but I don't know who that would be).   Sorry if this comes off as a shill or anything -- that is not my intent. I just wanted to share the good news about Iota's upcoming listing on this exchange. I can say that I've been using it since launch, and it is a really great UX. Top notch, in fact (and did I mention there are 0 trading fees). The only major problem at this time is the lack of liquidity on most tokens, but I think many are expecting this to improve with USDT pairings which begin in just a few days.   Thanks for your time -- happy purchasing and trading to all!","PSA: Iota to be listed on Cobinhood ""in the coming weeks"""

9869,0,"I believe in the tech of IOTA, and I believe it has the ability to kill the blockchain when it comes to currency. (not smart contracts, but currency) It has instant transactions and quasi-nonexistent fees. Why has it not taken over the entire cryptocurrency market yet?  I think the problem lies in the way we treat it. Think about it, in the height of Bitcoin's adoption, and now Bitcoin Cash's adoption, people were constantly j""campaigning"" to get their currency to be used in local businesses. The same thing was done and is still being done with Ethereum. Those campaigns have caused the currency to be used quite a bit, and to the detriment of blockchain technology, it's also caused those currencies to fail quite a bit. In Bitcoin Cash's case, it will fail eventually as well as adoption grows. With IOTA, we know that's not the case, because as adoption grows, the faster the tangle can process transactions.  We all know that IOTA is more geared towards IoT, but we all also know that it can be used just as much as a peer-to-peer currency. The fact of the matter is that IoT is not yet in a place to take full advantage of what IOTA has to offer. We instead need to start focusing on using IOTA as a peer-to-peer human currency.  I believe this is why XRB has gained so much momentum, even though I think the block-lattice design is far more complicated and that complication has caused exchanges to have many issues (don't take this as a hit piece on XRB, because I hold some, or rather *held* some in Bitgrail lol) XRB, though, has seen massive success because their community see it as a peer-to-peer currency.  We're here talking about using Teslas to communicate with smart roads and delivery drones and things like that, which is great, but the thing is that kind of technology use is probably 5-10 years out.  IOTA is way better than Bitcoin/Ethereum as an option for small businesses to accept cryptocurrency. There's no need for 0-conf because IOTA is already fast enough. We should be making websites like [acceptbitcoin.cash](http://www.acceptbitcoin.cash/) that further the use of IOTA as a currency and celebrate adoption. We need to be making technology and POS devices that directly communicate with the tangle and have the ability to verify transactions.  Remember, the more a currency is used, the more valuable it becomes. We're talking about teslas communicating with skynet over here while everyone is driving Toyota Camrys.","My Opinion on Why IOTA is in such a dumb place, and why it isn't a top 5 cryptocurrency."

I was one of the December buyers that felt like a genius during the bull run before January when I really knew nothing. Since then I have consolidated on investments and sold off bad coins/projects. I have dug into white papers and research during these dips without selling, but instead buying into the dip in what I believe in. I remember originally coming across IOTA but thinking it was to high. Read the white paper (way over my head in tech) and some other info and thought it was incredibly interesting, but being a newbie I saw FUD and went along.   Since then I have been reading more and more about the tech, listening to interviews, and deepening my understanding despite having any real technical background to truly understand the tech. From what I can understand it seems like this will be completely game changing and the real front runner as far as tech and real world adoption goes. The IOT market is huge and will only grow exponentially in upcoming years. I'm having a hard time finding any real competitors, but instead people resistant to change and needing to always validate Blockchain vs. DAG - Tangle.  That being said I am seriously considering selling off my majority of Eth in order to buy a decent stake (for my budget) as I believe this could and will overtake these other coins positions. I realize most people will agree here, but also looking for any suggestions as to why or why not.

9902,0,"If IOTA's tangle is the one to be used by the IOT industry, I believe, as of now, we can view IOTA as the bits flying around the infrastructure. As IOTA is finite, the infrastructure (IOTA's tangle) is finite. If speculators enter the market and drive up the price of the ""infrastructure"", potential partners (chip makers, corps, etc.) will be scared off. If the price of IOTA exceeds the value of its use in IOT use cases, The Tangle does not look attractive.   The Foundation seems to take this position as well and I think that, for the long term health of the project, it's best that IOTA value grows slowly and reflects the investments of the partners who will actually build out The Tangle.   I would expect that 2018 will see Bosch's work with IOTA help improve/validate its IOT business cases and such progress will draw in additional, larger chip players. IOTA should be a reasonable price when these other players start thinking about investing in the platform.   tldr; IOTA isn't like other coins/tokens and requires a different strategy for success.

9904,0,"https://www.industry-of-things.de/iot-basics-machine-to-machine-kommunikation-mit-iota-a-685194/  In short for non-germans:  IOTA is Bitcoin's biggest competitor. IOTA uses neither chains nor blocks. It uses so called tangles in a DAG. IOTA is a kind of database in which members can read and write at the same time. These tangles are replacing blocks and all the problems that come along with them in a blockchain. One of these problems is the long period for transactions through latency. But IOTA also needs ressources. Here also CPU power and memory are necessary. Addiotionally, IOTA's transactions are bigger than those in a blockchain. So we shouldn't expect wonders when it comes to IOTA. But IOTA needs less CPU power than is needed to confirm blockchain's transactions because no mining is needed anymore. That makes IOTA's transactions more efficient. But here also CPU power is needed. This power will be provided by those companies, that will use IOTA in future.  Because IOTA does not use blocks there is no need to finalize the size of blocks. This is one big problem that Bitcoin has. Though IoT devices need electrical power to run, they cause no additional costs in the IOTA network.  IOTA can also run it's transactions via bluetooth and other radio standards. So it's not necessary to have a UDP or TCP connection. Therefore it is expected that especially big companies will run IOTA nodes in future to feelessly transact their jobs that are supposed to be done by these companie's IoT-devices.  IOTA is one of the most discussed cryptocurrencies. Because IOTA does a lot of things differently, there's a big demand for discussions. Though heavyweight companies like VW and Bosch invested in IOTA, there are some critics. Wright now there are still too little amounts of transactions so that the network cannot play fully it's advantages. Additionally their servers do not run very stable yet so that losses of connectivity can occur.  But, anyway IOTA is a very interesting currency that has a chance to become a IoT standard.

New technology which can revolutionise the IOT and be the ""GAS"" between devices.  2. The IOTA Foundation. Super impressive the members which joined IOTA the last weeks and months.  If you think of each member as a Door Opener into an industry for Business Development, then you have quite a good ""Army"" now. Partnerships will follow... a lot is still in the making here what I feel. Also IOTA adds strategic foundation members e.g. for Security.  3. Who saw the interview with Ivan on Tech also knows a bit about the plans for more decentralisation.  Here also a great approach, first a strong network, then more decentralisation. End of 2018 hopefully the network could be strong enough to step by step shut down the coordinator node.  4. The new Ecosystem for Developers..  that really impressed me and is the KEY for adoption.  The Ecosystem has a developer fund , will have great Wikis and good documentations after some time. This is a big big pain point for most of the new Crypto projects if you don't want to use Ethereum.  Lacking of a great developer hub.  5. An aggressive management, still polite.  I mean they say what they want to say. And I think it is not that bad in the current state of IOTA to get the word out.  If you read interviews you see that the management team has a vision and is ""all-in"" IOTA.   It wouldn't surprise me if IOTA jumps to the #2 Place in Coinmarketcap this year behind Ethereum.  But let's see if IOTA will still be in coinmarketcap or will go out of the Crypto Ecosystem. (can't believe the last sentence, but they try to) ",IOTA does A LOT right. The price will follow!

9928,0,"I don't quite get why anyone would still choose to invest their money into blockchain based tech (which is slow, energy-expensive, and has fees), when there is now DAG technology (which gets faster with more users, and is totally free of fees), in the form of IOTA and IoT Chain?  It seems to me the same as if everyone used ATMs which charged you a fee for every cash withdrawal you made, a new ATM was then built right next to each of those ATMs (but one which was offered 100% free cash withdrawals), Why on earth would anyone choose to still use the one that charged them instead of the free one, unless they were just a fool?","Why do people still invest in Blockchain tech (which is slow + has fees), when there is now DAG tech (which is faster + has no fees??

9932,0,"Okay let me put some things straight here. I've seen a lot of videos and comments bout marketcap and the price of a currency.  But most people do not understand one very important fact: MARKETCAP IS RELATED TO CIRCULATING AMOUNT OF COINS AND NOT THE TOTAL AMOUNT!!! Now, what does this mean?  Well, let me explain it very simple in a little example: Let's say there is a coin with a total supply of 1000 coins with a price of 1$ per coin, ok? So the marketcap would be 1000*1$=1000$. That one was easy, right? Ok...then people start bying this coin.....let's say, that after 2 months of trading 500 of this coins are bought by investors....This would mean, that now there is still a TOTAL SUPPLY of 1000 coins BUT a CIRCULATING SUPPLY of ""only"" 500 coins left in the market for trading.  And now there comes a historical law of economics along: THE FEWER the amount of a commodity, the higher the price gets, because in EVERY market you always will have this balance between supply and demand! This means, that the fewer coins in circulation, the higher the price per coin. And this price then is NOT related to the total supply, but only to the actual circulating supply of coins! It's ALWAYS ABOUT THE FREE FLOAT and NOT the total amount of a commodity. This is why it's called marketcapitalization and NOT privatecapitalization. It's about the amount that is actually in the market!  So if there's only 500 coins circulating in our example, and traders are ready to pay 4$, beacause sellers won't sell for under 4$, then the marketcap is 500*4$=2000$! And the second very important thing: The price of a coin determines the marketcap and NOT vice versa!!! It's not, that first the marketcap all of a sudden changes and then the price of a coin. No it's in opposite: First the price of a coin raises when the demand raises or it starts falling when peaple start selling - and THEN the marketcap changes!   So you if you're asking something like: ""Hey is it possible that MIOTA hits 1000$ one day?"" - well then you have to keep all these facts in mind and additionally you have to ask always: Is the total supply of a coin finalized or are there coins mined? The answer is: IF the circulating supply of MIOTAS out there becomes so small while the demand for MIOTA stays constant or raises, well then of course the price can hit 1000$ per coin! The more people are buying, the fewer coins are out there in the market as circulationg supply!  I hope this helps you folks out there by thinking bout prices and predictions of coinprices.
